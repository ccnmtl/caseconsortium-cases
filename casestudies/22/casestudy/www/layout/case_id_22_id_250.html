    <div class="content"><p>On Thursday, May 29, at 6:07 in the morning, <i>Today</i> host Humphrys interviewed Gilligan in what was known as a &ldquo;two-way&rdquo;&mdash;a dialogue intended to sound like a friendly conversation, not a formal report. It was a &ldquo;tease,&rdquo; or preview, of the larger story to come later in the program&mdash;in this case at 7:30 a.m. BBC reporters understood that any two-way would closely follow the wording of the later news report, but the first hour of the <i>Today</i> program was largely done live; it was neither scripted nor pre-recorded. The subject was the September 2002 intelligence dossier.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;<i>Probably knew.&rdquo;</i></b> Gilligan told Humphrys that &ldquo;one of the senior officials in charge of drawing up that dossier&rdquo; had told him that &ldquo;the government probably knew that the 45-minute figure was wrong even before it decided to put it in.&rdquo; Gilligan couched this assertion of government foreknowledge as something the source said, not as Gilligan&rsquo;s own speculation. Gilligan did not elaborate on what was meant by &ldquo;government&rdquo;&mdash;the prime minister himself, his director of communications, the Defense Ministry, or the MI5 or MI6 intelligence agencies. This phrase&mdash;&ldquo;probably knew that the 45-minute figure was wrong&rdquo;&mdash;was not in the script. Gilligan also reported that his source cited the 45-minute claim as an example of how the government &ldquo;sexed up&rdquo;&mdash;or made more provocative&mdash;the dossier. He also reported that the 45-minute claim was based on a single source of dubious accuracy, which is why it made intelligence officials uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Marsh was one of many BBC officials who listened to the 6:07 exchange. But, he says, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pick up on the &lsquo;probably they knew it was wrong&rsquo; line. I wasn&rsquo;t sitting there checking it against the script.&rdquo; He did, however, anticipate a protest&mdash;because the government protested so much of what the <i>Today</i> program broadcast, from the slant of economic news to the use of statistics on the national health service. &ldquo;In any one day,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you probably get five official-looking letters. In any week, you&rsquo;ll get two from solicitors [lawyers], and 100 phone calls, all from people telling you you&rsquo;re the stupidest person who&rsquo;s ever walked the face of the earth... Letters from Downing Street were not rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i><b>Government protest.</b></i> Prime Minister Tony Blair and his communications director, Alastair Campbell, were at the time visiting Basra, Iraq. So they had no immediate comment. But at 7:15 a.m., a spokesman from No. 10 Downing Street, the prime minister&rsquo;s office, called to protest the story. A <a class="pdflink" target="_blank" href="../../files/bbc/statement_715_downingst.pdf">statement</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These allegations are untrue. Not one word of the dossier was not entirely the work of the intelligence agencies. The suggestion that any pressure was put on the intelligence services by No. 10 or anyone else to change the document are entirely false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To BBC editors&rsquo; ears, says Marsh, the double negative sounded like a &rdquo;non-denial denial.&rdquo; Meanwhile, at 7:30 a.m., Gilligan followed up with the actual news report which he had scripted in advance. He did not repeat the phrase &ldquo;probably knew.&rdquo; But he did say, &ldquo;What I have been told is that the government knew that claim was questionable.&rdquo; Gilligan quoted his source directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He said, &lsquo;It was transformed in the week before it was published, to make it sexier. The classic example was the statement that weapons of mass destruction were ready for use within 45 minutes. That information was not in the original draft. It was included in the dossier against our wishes because it wasn&rsquo;t reliable. Most things in the dossier were double source, but that was single source, and we believed that the source was wrong.&rsquo;</p>

</p>
<p>At 8:28 a.m., Humphrys interviewed Armed Forces Minister Ingram by pre-arrangement about the cluster bombs story. Humphrys also asked for reaction to the September dossier story. In response, Ingram admitted that the 45-minute intelligence claim was based on a single source. From the BBC&rsquo;s viewpoint, that substantiated Gilligan&rsquo;s report. But Ingram also denied the allegation that there had been any pressure from Downing Street to alter the dossier&rsquo;s language: &ldquo;That is not the case. There was no pressure from No. 10.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the program, Marsh asked to see Gilligan&rsquo;s notes. The reporter forwarded the <a class="pdflink" target="_blank" href="../../files/bbc/notes_gilligan_for_holt.pdf">typewritten notes</a> he had provided to Holt the night before, based on the original notations on his PDA.</p></div>
