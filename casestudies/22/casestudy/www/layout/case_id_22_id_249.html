    <div class="content"><p>On Wednesday, <i>Today</i> program editor Kevin Marsh held his usual two daily editorial meetings. At the morning one, editors typically brainstormed story ideas, while the afternoon meeting focused on pinning down the running order for the leading items. On this occasion, there were two big stories&mdash;the shooting of a British peace activist on Palestinian land; and a leaked report that British troops in Iraq had used cluster bombs. The second meeting wrapped up about 5 p.m., and Marsh prepared to go home. As he did, the day editor, Senior Assistant Editor Miranda Holt, stopped off to tell Marsh that Gilligan had submitted a story about the September dossier.</p>
<p>Gilligan had told Holt that Marsh knew about the story, but Marsh says he did not. &ldquo;Andrew&rsquo;s work method was to be very secretive about everything,&rdquo; says Marsh, adding that many reporters preferred to hold work close to the chest until it was ready for broadcast for fear of losing a scoop. Holt explained that the story charged the dossier had selectively cited intelligence which supported the case for war. Gilligan&mdash;as was standard practice&mdash;had not named his source, but told Holt it was someone involved in drawing up the dossier. The source said claims about Saddam&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction were exaggerated, and that many of the qualifiers in the original intelligence had been edited out.</p>
<p><i><b>Confirming details.</b></i> Marsh thought he recognized the story. By coincidence, he had had lunch that day with former Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short, who had been in the cabinet when the September dossier was published.<sup><a title="txtfn27" name="txtfn27"></a><a href="case_id_22_id_249.html#fn27">[27]</a></sup> Marsh says Short told him that &ldquo;Alastair Campbell had edited highlights from the intelligence, that she didn&rsquo;t believe that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that as far as she knew... people in the intelligence services were unhappy with the way that the intelligence had been handled.&rdquo; Moreover, on April 9, Marsh had had lunch with MI6 director Sir Richard Dearlove. Formally, MI6 was called the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and was responsible for foreign intelligence, while MI5 (Security Service) controlled domestic intelligence. Dearlove had also hinted that perhaps there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; he cryptically alluded to the fact that the real threats in the region were Syria and Iran.</p>
<p>In this context, says Marsh, Gilligan&rsquo;s story &ldquo;frankly was not very surprising... It wasn&rsquo;t that exclusive.&rdquo; Gilligan agrees: &ldquo;It had certainly been in the air. We didn&rsquo;t regard this as a particularly significant story. I thought it was an okay story.&rdquo; Marsh asked Holt whether the source was sufficiently senior to have access to this information; she responded that Gilligan had identified him as a lead United Nations weapons inspector, a scientist and former reliable source for Gilligan. Marsh also asked if there were direct quotes, and Holt replied yes&mdash;Gilligan had emailed her one and a half pages of comments in quotation marks from the interview. So Marsh asked that Gilligan write a script for the story&mdash;as was standard practice&mdash;and asked to review the script before broadcast.</p>
<p><i><b>Source reliable.</b></i> Marsh also gave orders that the direct quotes be voiced over by an actor&mdash;making it clear to listeners that they were listening to the actual words of the source. &ldquo;This obviously gives the quotes greater validity, and therefore you have to be sure they&rsquo;re quotes. And I was assured they were,&rdquo; says Marsh. Gilligan <a href="../../files/bbc/gilligan_script.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdflink">scripted</a> the story, which was scheduled to run at 7:30 the next morning, just at the start of the peak audience hour that ran until 8:30 a.m. Marsh says he &ldquo;looked over the script overnight, and the two editors looked over the script, and everybody was fine with the script as it existed.&rdquo; Gilligan and Marsh also spoke by phone. Their conversation focused on the wisdom of running a single-sourced story, and just how reliable Gilligan considered his source to be. Without disclosing Kelly&rsquo;s identity, Gilligan assured Marsh the source was impeccable. Marsh decided to run the story. &ldquo;It was not my decision to do it, it was his decision,&rdquo; says Gilligan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the editor&rsquo;s call, not the reporter&rsquo;s, whether to do the story or not. And he said yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, as was expected under BBC guidelines on right of reply, the <i>Today</i> program lined up a government official to address the charges in Gilligan&rsquo;s story. <i>Today</i> had already approached Armed Forces Minister Alan Ingram to respond to the story about cluster bombs, and had booked Ingram for a live interview at about 8:30 a.m. A <i>Today</i> staffer said Ingram was asked to speak to Gilligan&rsquo;s story as well. Moreover, Gilligan says he described his story about the exaggerated dossier to Ministry of Defense press officer Kate Wilson in a Wednesday evening telephone conversation; she is certain he did not. Neither of them took notes and the discrepancy has proven impossible to reconcile.</p>
