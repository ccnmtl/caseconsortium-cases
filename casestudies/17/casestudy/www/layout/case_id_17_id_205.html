         By the end of March, Logan was getting angry—and worried. Some of the anger was due to a sense that she was being overworked, and expected to do too much with too little oversight or back-up. But the worry reflected Logan’s concern that her blog was undercutting her ability to be a responsible and credible journalist.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          <strong>
           Multitasking.
          </strong>
         </em>
         How was she supposed to listen carefully to the nuances of a trial if she was simultaneously to take notes, send blog entries, and keep track of time code on the video? As Logan wrote to a fellow reporter: “Listening requires all of my attention. It [the trial] is very detail intensive. And tiny details can make the whole story.” Her editor, Peterson, sympathized. Peterson had applauded the blog idea when it was first proposed, but when she saw it in action she grew skeptical. Active listening, as she knew well, required full attention. She explains:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Are you watching the trial thinking, "This contradicts what I heard two days ago." Or "how does this fit with what this other witness said?" It [listening] is about hearing inconsistencies and even "I see that this is an important quote to use." How much do you get to do that when you’re creating [what is essentially] a transcript?

          <strong>
           Mistakes.
          </strong>
         </em>
         Logan had already confirmed that she was making spelling and grammatical errors. But it was potential errors of fact which worried her more. Mistakes, even seemingly trivial ones, were not taken lightly in the pages of the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         . Editors carefully tracked factual, spelling, and style errors in the paper. It published corrections in a consistent and visible manner. Staff reporters’ personnel files included any violations—known as
         <a class="pdflink" href="../../files/bakersfield/ftr.pdf" target="_blank">
          For The Record
         </a>
         , or FTRs—of the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         ’s stringent corrections policy. During annual employee reviews, notes Peterson, “the boss for whoever made the error [pulls] those out and we look at them… Depending on the nature of the error, as little as one could have you not having a job anymore.” The policy stated:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Accuracy is our top priority and a basic expectation of any journalist. When mistakes appear, the journalist’s own credibility is damaged, the readers’ trust is shaken, and the ultimate outcome of an ensuing loss of readership could threaten our very existence. Therefore, we take all errors seriously—particularly avoidable verification errors—striving to correct them as soon as possible and taking steps to prevent them from recurring. Repeated or egregious errors may result in disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Yet there was no system in place to track reporters’ online errors. Most material on the website did go first through an editor; but that was not true for blogs. There was no editing. Jenner says he personally considered the reporting standards for the Web and the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         as “the same,” but acknowledges that the company had no written standards or guidelines for online corrections. Occasional spelling errors or repetitions in Logan’s blogs did not, he says, detract from the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         ’s service to readers. He adds:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          She [Logan] thought it would be copyedited before it went out. It wasn’t. We didn’t do that. And in fact, we really didn’t do much editing at all because I don’t think we needed to. It’s not perfect, but it’s a blog.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Peterson confirms that the Brothers trial blog entries went online unedited. Peterson did not read Logan’s posts. “Would I have liked to? Yeah,” she says. But at the time, she was “responsible for 13 full-time reporters, two assistant editors, and two regularly scheduled freelance columnists. So am I going to be editing her blog all day? No, I’m not. She [Logan] was extremely nervous about that, and I understand.” At the same time, Peterson felt someone should have been editing the entries: “When you’re sending information out to your reading community, you have an obligation to serve it with fair, accurate, and balanced information.”
        </p>
        <p>
         During the same time period, errors—of style, grammar, and syntax—by other
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         reporters also made their way onto the website, says Peterson: “Certain things were posted to the Web without, in my mind, adequate review by a second person.” Errors were corrected only when an editor happened upon them online, or a reader pointed them out. “That’s not okay with me,” Peterson says. “If it’s from our staff, someone has to read it.” Yet Peterson felt herself largely powerless to intervene on Logan’s behalf. “With a ‘Web first’ mandate in the newsroom, the Web editor, and the immediate deadline, is going to win,” she notes.
        </p>
        <p>
         By April, Logan’s frustration with the lack of editing had only worsened. On April 9, for example, she sent a post to
         <a class="pdflink" href="../../files/bakersfield/post4_9_3_47.pdf" target="_blank">
          the blog at 3:47 p.m.
         </a>
         about phone calls made to and from the accused’s cellphone. She wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          A third call was generaged 21:13 or 9:13 p.m. EDT or 6:13 p.m. PDT. The call was placed to Joanie Harper’s cellular telephone on July 2, 2003. It was placed from AT and T wireless system in Columbus Ohio.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         One sentence later, she recorded: “On July 3, 2003, at 23:44, 11:44 PDT from the hoome phone of Carla Tafoya to Vincent Brothers’ cellular telephone. It went to voice mail of Vincent Brothers.” While it could be argued that the spelling errors in this and other posts were inconsequential, later in the same April 9 posting Logan in fact made a mistake. She wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Fourteenth call 16:05 hours, 4:05 PDT on July 6, 2003, from Earnestine Harper’s phone to Vincent Brothers’ cellular telephone. “This is an unusual phone record to have,” [sic]
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         The reference to a phone call at 4:05 PDT then made it into
         <a class="pdflink" href="../../files/bakersfield/article02_0.pdf" target="_blank">
          the main story
         </a>
         she filed for the April 10 newspaper.
         <sup>
          <a name="txtfn22" title="txtfn22">
          </a>
          <a href="case_id_17_id_205.html#fn22">
           [22]
          </a>
         </sup>
         But there had been no such call. The newspaper ran a correction the next day. No correction was made to the blog. Logan filled out an FTR form for Peterson on April 12 regarding the newspaper error. She described the mistake as a "source error," saying the prosecution and the defense each characterized the phone call differently. On the form, Peterson noted that the attorneys were under a gag order and therefore unable to clear up any misunderstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Logan was not surprised that a mistake crept in to that story in particular. The most difficult part of the trial, she says, was “listening to highly technical testimony and writing the blogs at the same time.” Logan recalls frantically trying to listen to the exact numbers and write them down. “I was kind of terrified” of what she called the witnesses’ rapid-fire testimony. “I just did the best that I could,” she says. This type of detailed testimony rattled her most, but even listening to witnesses recount seemingly simple facts was often confusing.  She adds:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          It was difficult to keep up even with witnesses who say they saw Brothers at a certain time or had a relationship with him at a certain time. These witnesses would change their stories mid-stream and [testimony] is difficult to capture unless you are giving [the witnesses] your entire focus.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         On April 16, the seventh week of her blogging from the trial, Logan emailed Web Editor McHenry about the website’s policy on spelling errors. He replied: “We don’t run spell check on any blogs as policy. In fact we run blog comments with obvious misspellings in the newspaper when we scrape blogs for print.” He assured her that readers considered her blog posts “a raw feed.” Logan persisted, suggesting that “it would be a good idea for someone back at the ranch to reread and maybe run a spell check. Don’t you think?” McHenry disagreed. “I think we should read them. But I’m not inclined to edit them,” he wrote. He told her “you’re thinking of these blog posts as stories.”
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          They are not. The blog is like a sneak peek into your notebook. You cannot apply the same standards to these posts as you do to a story that runs in print. The fact that we’ve had only a couple complaints over the course of hundreds of blog posts tells me that the lion’s share of readers understand the concept.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         That same day, Logan emailed Swenson in his role as union president and asked him if he thought careless mistakes, including spelling errors, “affect how people view you as a reporter.” She asked him if he would speak to McHenry about the situation.
