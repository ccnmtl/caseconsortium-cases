         The
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         had gone a long way by 2005 towards making its online product visually appealing and conceptually attractive to readers. Blogs, or weblogs, were only one of the enhancements—which also included video, audio, photographs, podcasts, links to related sites, and so forth. But blogs were emerging across the country as a new way to interact with readers. Reporters, commentators, and others could use a blog to write in an informal voice and get reaction from readers. The word “blog,” however, was an imprecise term of art and meant different things to different people. Some used blogs to introduce new information on a breaking story. Others considered it akin to a “reporter’s notebook,” a place to record impressions and opinions which did not belong in a traditional news story. Most blogs provided space for comments, which allowed readers to give feedback on their own views and reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2005, there were only a handful of blogs at the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         . Swenson, in addition to monitoring those, was expected to write his own. Jenner wanted Swenson’s new daily blog to comment on current news events. Swenson agonized over his job change. “I didn’t know what a blog was to start with,” he says. Once he did understand blogging, he was even more worried: Now he would have to voice an opinion. “My biggest fear was that I was no longer going to be able to do the kind of journalism I was trained to do,” he says. “I spent my whole career not expressing my opinion and trying to be evenhanded.”
        </p>
        <p>
         But Swenson came to love the new job. He delighted in the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         ’s ability to post news stories online before local television news shows—or even the television stations’ websites. “We have usurped TV at their own game,” he says. He had at first opposed posting breaking stories on the Web because it would allow competitors to read online what was in the works at the newspaper. But Swenson says he soon realized that “scooping is scooping. And if it’s only by a few minutes in the middle of the day, so be it: It’s a scoop.” Swenson’s new job delivered an unexpected bonus: He proposed to his wife on his blog.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, then-Assistant City Editor
         <a href="case_id_17_id_33_c_bio.html">
          Davin McHenry
         </a>
         moved over to become the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         ’s first Web editor. He accepted the job in large part because he knew Jenner and Molen were willing to take risks. “Frankly, we’re not the
         <em>
          New York Times
         </em>
         . We’re a smaller family newspaper,” says McHenry. “I don’t think there’s ever been a time that you can’t talk to the bosses and you can’t have ideas. It was clear that if I had ideas I could throw them out and try and make them reality.”
         <sup>
          <a name="txtfn7" title="txtfn7">
          </a>
          <a href="case_id_17_id_201.html#fn7">
           [7]
          </a>
         </sup>
         Under Jenner and McHenry, the website expanded and became more ambitious. Some Bakersfield.com stories updated the day’s news; others were stand-alone features.
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         editors and reporters even created podcasts recording their experiences reporting certain stories, a kind of “making of the story” story.
        </p>
        <p>
         Within two years, Jenner’s goal of creating a “Web first” newsroom was beginning to take shape. Bakersfield.com was not just a Web version of the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         , but its own news entity. In a seismic shift, most of the
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         ’s reporters would say they worked not just for the newspaper, but also for the website and all future integrated media. Indeed, by early 2007 candidates for
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         staff positions were expected to know how to shoot video and be web savvy. Notes Jenner:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          We’re a platform agnostic, multi-channel, disseminator of stuff. If you want it on a cell phone, no problem. If you want it on your computer, no problem. If you want a video, if you want to watch it on YouTube.com, no problem. We need to provide (information) and monetize it. I don’t know about a pot of gold but there has to be a pile of nickels somewhere at the end of the rainbow.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         As for blogs, they had mushroomed—both those written by reporters and those written by readers. In 2006, Jenner himself began a short, signed weekly blog, “Sound Off,” where readers could comment, complain, praise or question Jenner directly about stories.

         </sup>
         Another early and popular blog was “The Pulse,” written by the paper’s health reporter.

         . But the
         <em>
          Californian’
         </em>
         s rules about blogging were unwritten—and unclear. Some blogs included the reporter’s name; others did not. Some were directly related to a reporter’s beat, while others explored different topics.
         <sup>
          <a name="txtfn9" title="txtfn9">

         </sup>
         Though a
         <em>
          Californian
         </em>
         employee handbook used in 2007 contained clearly stated guidelines about avoiding a conflict of interest in reporting stories, it did not reference the Web. Both Jenner and Web Editor McHenry say the
         <em>
          Californian’
         </em>
         s reporters were professionals and knew where and when to draw the line between reporting and expressing personal opinions on the subjects they covered.
        </p>
        <p>
         When a celebrated local murder case finally came to trial in early 2007, editors felt that a blog from the courtroom—a first for the paper—would be a logical next step for the news organization.

          “Sound Off” had started in 2000 as a feature in the newspaper, and in the online version of the print product. In 2006, it relaunched as a blog.

          Some
          <em>
           Californian
          </em>
          reporters wrote personal blogs and linked them to Bakersfield.com without informing or securing approval from editors (Jenner says he and other editors were mostly unaware of this practice). The links were one-way, and did not lead from the Bakersfield site to the reporters’ blogs.
