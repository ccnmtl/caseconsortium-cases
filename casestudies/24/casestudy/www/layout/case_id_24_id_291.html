         Ingwerson turned to his computer. He had known for two days that the story would break, and that the
         <i>
          Monitor
         </i>
         would need to make a public statement. He also knew that the importance of the statement could hardly be overstated. It would be the paper’s first and best chance to secure Carroll’s release because the kidnappers would likely be waiting for it.
        </p>
        <p>
         <i>
          <b>
           Statement.
          </b>
         </i>
         The statement had to emphasize Carroll’s professionalism, her sympathies with the Arab world, and her commitment to giving voice to ordinary Iraqis. The
         <i>
          Monitor
         </i>
         had to make clear its commitment to her and her safety, but without making her seem too important. Ingwerson had been keeping notes over the previous 48 hours of talking points he wanted to include. Now he pulled those notes out to compose a statement.
        </p>
        <p>
         He emphasized that Carroll worked for several news organizations based in the US and abroad, including Middle Eastern and Italian newspapers, and that many of her stories covered the war’s effects on Iraqi citizens’ daily lives. By downplaying her affiliation with a US newspaper and focusing on her freelancing, Ingwerson calculated that he could lower her value to the kidnappers. Following CPJ’s advice, he added details about her track record as a journalist.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ingwerson also pointed out Carroll’s interest in the Arab world. He recalled her own words from the 2005
         <i>
          American Journalism Review
         </i>
         article she had written: that she “had moved to Jordan six months before the war began to learn as much as possible about the region before the fighting began.” She did not want to be a “parachute journalist.” She learned to speak Arabic and immersed herself in Middle Eastern culture. Ingwerson added a quote from Editor Bergenheim:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Jill’s ability to help others understand the issues facing all groups in Iraq has been invaluable. We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release.
          <sup>

           </a>
          </sup>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Ingwerson and the rest of Team Jill fretted over how the word “Christian” in the newspaper’s name might sit with the kidnappers, who were most likely Muslim. The last paragraph, Ingwerson hoped, would minimize the word’s impact:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Founded in 1908, the
          <i>

          <i>
           Monitor

           </a>
          </sup>
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Ingwerson ran his draft by the team, including the Baghdad Boys, for feedback. Every word was scrutinized for any possible negative connotation. The FBI agent stationed in his office, however, was not permitted to edit it. “They [FBI] certainly had opinions about what we should be saying and what we shouldn’t be saying,” he says.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <i>
          Monitor
         </i>
         posted the final version of the
         <a class="pdflink" href="../../files/csm/csm_stmt20060110.pdf" target="_blank">
          statement
         </a>
         to its website on Monday at 10 a.m. In addition, Peterson filed a story from Baghdad for the Tuesday edition. He included interviews with Foreign Editor Scott, and Carroll’s driver. Finally, Ingwerson notified CPJ that the news blackout had been lifted. Quickly, CPJ posted a
         <a class="pdflink" href="../../files/csm/cpj_stmt200601.pdf" target="_blank">
          statement
         </a>
         on its own website calling for Carroll’s release.

           Full-time staff.
          </b>
         </i>
         On Tuesday, January 10, Bergenheim announced to Team Jill that Carroll now was a full-time staffer. Since day one of her kidnapping, Bergenheim had been in touch with the paper’s board of directors almost daily to keep them apprised of Team Jill’s efforts. “The decision to make her an employee was something that we addressed with them in just trying to provide for Jill whatever needs she would have when she was released,” he says. The board helped him think through the choices, but the decision was Bergenheim’s. “After looking at any number of options, having her as an employee was sort of the cleanest and in some ways more generous way of dealing with it,” Bergenheim says. As a full-timer, Carroll would receive full health benefits, and he wanted to ensure that she could receive proper medical or psychological treatment if necessary after her release. The move also meant that Carroll would be paid a salary while in captivity. Because her new status could elevate her value in the eyes of her captors, however, Bergenheim asked the staff to keep the change secret.
