	From the start, Fried envisioned a major, multi-year evaluation of Baltimore Experience Corps, with large sample sizes of both volunteers and schools and with both groups randomized. Such a study would cost a lot of money to execute&mdash;well over $1 million a year. The National Institutes of Health was the place to seek funding. But any NIH grant application would have to show strong preliminary evidence that Experience Corps&mdash;and a long-term evaluation of the program&mdash;were feasible in Baltimore. Results from the earlier demonstration projects would not be enough. Those evaluations did not meet strict scientific standards and they did not include Baltimore.</p>
<p>
	<em>Pilot</em>. The first step was to conduct a two-year pilot study in Baltimore. During this period, COAH and GHCC could test methods for recruiting volunteers, see whether they could attract and keep schools involved, and pilot methods of evaluation. The results would have to convince the NIH that both the program and the study were doable, and that Experience Corps was promising enough to warrant a costly RCT.</p>
<p>
	It was unclear whether older people would be willing to volunteer for Experience Corps <em>and </em>take part in the study. Some in inner-Baltimore&rsquo;s predominantly African-American community mistrusted Johns Hopkins. The university&rsquo;s reputation had been tarnished by rumors that it had performed unethical research on black residents in the past. Other charges related to the Henrietta Lacks case, when the university collected cells from a black woman and used them for research without informing her family.<sup><a href="case_id_125_id_875.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[12]</a></sup> According to McGill, negative perceptions took some effort to dispel. &ldquo;It took a while for people to understand that this [study] didn&rsquo;t have the potential to be damaging,&rdquo; says McGill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	McGill recalls that recruitment of volunteers was arduous. She and Fried held scores of information sessions at community centers, churches and retirement homes. It wasn&rsquo;t clear that they would be able to attract enough volunteers ahead of the intended start of the pilot in early 1999. They didn&rsquo;t want to let down the principals of the six schools that GHCC had signed on (three would be controls). If it proved impossible to get volunteers to agree to be randomized, there would be no hope for a larger RCT; the NIH grant would be moot. But Fried was optimistic. &ldquo;If I had acceded to what I was being told by everybody, which is that nobody would ever accept randomization, we never would have had the pilot, and we would have no evaluation data,&rdquo; she says.Another, potentially larger, obstacle to recruitment would be persuading volunteers to agree to random placement in either the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group or the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group. In other words, potential volunteers would have to accept that there was a 50 percent chance of <em>not </em>being able to do what they really wanted: work with vulnerable kids at schools in need. If placed in the control group, they would not be eligible for the stipend, either&mdash;and results from the five-city demonstration showed that this was a significant incentive for people of modest means. Moreover, those in the control group would still have to submit to regular interviews and physical check-ups, just like those in the treatment group, so that their health data could be later compared.</p>
<p>
	In the end, McGill and Fried were able to meet the quota. McGill cites the fact that COAH, when pressured by McGill and executives at GHCC, was eventually persuaded to reduce the commitment for control-group volunteers from two years to one; after that, they could join the treatment group and work in the classroom. Fried credits their success to an honest and respectful approach:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		What I said to potential volunteers was, &lsquo;We think this program could really matter. But the only way we can see if it really matters, and that we&rsquo;re not wasting your time and the kids&rsquo; time, is if&hellip; we evaluate it honestly. And the only way to do that is to ask you to accept a lottery.&rsquo; Which is another way to say we&rsquo;re going to randomize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	With this, subjects tended to understand and agree with the purpose of the study. Nevertheless, Fried recalls with fondness one recruitment meeting that ended in a prayer session, in which the leader of the prayer beseeched the Almighty to randomize her into the treatment group. Fried notes that the common wisdom at the time was that African-Americans and people of lower income would not volunteer, and would certainly not agree to be part of an RCT. That view was disproven. &rdquo;People are fussy&mdash;as they should be&mdash;that if they&rsquo;re going to volunteer, they want it to be in a program that they think is making a difference. They want their time well used,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>
	<em>Program changes</em>. In addition to changing the commitment of control group volunteers from two years to one, McGill recalls other ways that COAH adjusted its methods to accommodate the reality on the ground. For example, program delivery underwent changes. Principals insisted that volunteers help implement the schools&rsquo; curriculum, not just the curriculum that Experience Corps Baltimore had developed. As a former teacher in the community, McGill was not surprised by this demand, and COAH agreed to modify the curriculum that volunteers were trained to deliver.</p>
<p>
	From early 1999 to June 2000, COAH and GHCC conducted the pilot. As with the earlier five-city demonstration, the Baltimore experiment showed that Experience Corps held promise. Volunteers&rsquo; health indicators improved. Children&rsquo;s scores on state tests were up. Teachers and principals alike praised the program. In fact, the results were even more compelling than for the demonstration, because the schools and volunteers had been randomized and many more measures were assessed. The challenge now would be to convince the NIH, through the grant application, to support a definitive evaluation&mdash;a large-scale, long-term, rigorous and expensive RCT.</p>
<p>
	Over the following four years, COAH researchers pored over data from the pilot and prepared their case for the NIH. At the same time, COAH and GHCC continued to operate and expand Experience Corps in Baltimore, bringing on board more volunteers and schools every year. Fried and McGill met regularly, along with researchers from COAH and executives from GHCC, to handle issues regarding operations, funding and research.</p>

During treatment, researchers had collected cells from her body; after her death, they bred the cells in vitro, creating the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;immortal cell line.&rdquo; The cells were used in thousands of medical experiments over the years, including work by Jonah Salk leading to his cure for polio. But Lacks&rsquo; family remained unaware of the use of her cells until the 1970s. Some have criticized Johns Hopkins for failing to inform or compensate the family.</span></p>
