<p>
	In 2004, COAH submitted a grant application to NIH to fund a five-year RCT of Experience Corps. COAH asked for funds to cover the costs of recruitment, training, stipends and data collection and analysis. There would still be additional operational costs not covered by NIH funds. Apart from the research, it cost about $75,000 per school per year to operate Experience Corps, according to William Miller, then-GHCC director and McGill&rsquo;s supervisor. This came from a variety of funding sources: foundations, donors and principals&rsquo; discretionary budgets. (The fact that principals willingly allocated the required $25,000 from their own budgets spoke to their belief in the effectiveness of Experience Corps.)</p>
<p>
	In the application, COAH proposed recruiting 700 volunteers, age 60 and older, who were willing to be randomized: half to the intervention and half to the control group. Those in the treatment group would commit to attend a one-week, 30-hour training program and work a minimum of 15 hours per week for at least one school year. They would form teams of 7-10; each school would get a critical mass of 15-20 volunteers (i.e. one or two teams).</p>
<p>
	For final eligibility, treatment group participants also had to be functionally literate (at or above the 6<sup>th</sup> grade level), pass a mental health exam and a criminal background check, submit to an alcohol breathalyzer and be behaviorally acceptable to the principal of the assigned school. (Those who did not pass these requirements would be barred from the classroom but kept in the study, using &ldquo;intention-to-treat&rdquo; methodology.<sup><a href="case_id_125_id_876.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;It was assumed there would be about the same proportion of &ldquo;ineligible&rdquo; volunteers in both the control and the treatment groups.) The volunteers would work only with grades K-3. Volunteers in the treatment group would receive a stipend of approximately $250 per month (taxable), to cover out-of-pocket expenses. For participating in evaluations, volunteers in both groups would receive a $10 gift card for evaluations by phone and a $25 gift card for in-person interviews. Evaluations would take place every four months.</p>
<p>
	COAH proposed that 20 schools take part in the RCT. As with the volunteers, interested principals would have to agree beforehand to random placement into the control or the treatment group. Control group schools would play no active role in the study because all the evaluation data, such as children&rsquo;s literacy scores and behavior records, would be supplied to COAH by the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS). The grant application stated the researchers&rsquo; hypotheses:<sup><a href="case_id_125_id_876.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Well-trained, older volunteers engaged in a high-intensity service program and placed in a critical mass in public elementary schools, could have significant impact on the academic success of children in K-3<sup>rd</sup> grade, as measured by improvements in children&#39;s reading, by standardized achievement tests and school record data, as well as improvements in classroom behavior.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		A critical mass of volunteers serving with a high-intensity time commitment would positively affect school climate, teacher retention, and teacher absenteeism.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Such a program, carefully designed to deliver a clinically significant prevention &ldquo;dose&rdquo; of physical, social, and cognitive activities to the older volunteers, would decrease disability, falls, frailty and depression, and reduce declines in memory and executive function. It would improve social supports, and generate a sense of self-efficacy and purpose in life.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Outcomes for both volunteers and students would create a positive feedback loop, with children&#39;s improvements positively affecting retention and program satisfaction of volunteers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Although the NIH rejected the 2004 application, Fried was undaunted, and prepared to re-submit in 2005. Based on NIH parameters, however, COAH could request only some $750,000 per year in the 2005 application, about half what it had requested the year before. That would not be nearly enough to cover the costs of the RCT. COAH would have to piece together other funding sources and, even then, the researchers would undoubtedly have to put in a lot of pro bono work. Still, without a sizeable annual contribution from NIH, a long-term study would be impossible. The grant was essential to Fried&rsquo;s goals of conducting a definitive evaluation of the program&rsquo;s impact on both children and older adults. Making the 2005 application more fraught, tensions were flaring between COAH and GHCC over the study&rsquo;s methodology.</p>
