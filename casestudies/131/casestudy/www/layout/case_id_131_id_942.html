    <div class="content"><p>
	In 2005, FC had decided to expand in Cali beyond Aguablanca. It looked at a hilly area on the western edge of the city.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_942.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[6]</a></sup> Cali was divided into 21 administrative units called <em>comunas</em>. FC had previously worked in <em>comunas</em> 13, 14 and 15 in the Aguablanca district. The city limit to the east was the Cauca river and the area was rather flat. To the west lay <em>comunas</em> 1, 18, 19 and 20, surrounded by a mountain range and quite steep.</p>

</div>
<p>
	Neither nongovernmental organizations nor the government provided any services to the recently established communities in the west. FC wanted in expanding to take advantage of what it had learned about community-building in Aguablanca. First, a research team studied the neighborhoods. Which ones should FC select? What was important to each community? Who were the players? Who had influence? Focusing on the vulnerable was a priority, but FC also wanted the consent and active participation of the community in any improvement project. It needed to understand a community before choosing to work there.</p>
<p>
	In late 2005, FC social workers spent time walking through the target neighborhoods. Teams of two social workers were assigned specific areas. These teams used a set of criteria to guide their observations and information gathering and recorded the data in a matrix.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_942.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[7]</a></sup> The criteria stipulated what social workers should observe and the matrix allowed them to record the ways in which the variables changed across sites. On December 14, the team presented a report on the chief characteristics of six areas: <em>comunas</em> 1, 2, 18 and the jurisdictions of La Buitrera, Montebello and Golondrinas. The report drew on FC&rsquo;s own observations as well as on quantitative and qualitative data from the municipality, the media, and the little literature available.</p>
<p>
	After the presentation, the research team created a second matrix, based on the first one but broader. Matrix #2 measured each variable on a scale from 1-100.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_942.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[8]</a></sup> The matrix allowed the team to analyze the sites based on wider criteria than observation alone, and to set priorities. By late December, it was able to select two areas based on vulnerability and opportunity: <em>comuna</em> 18 and Montebello. FC called the expansion area the &ldquo;territory of Ladera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The next step was to build trust. Dulce recommended that FC wait before starting concrete development activities. Instead of starting with a full package of services, he wanted first to establish a relationship with the community. Projects would come only after serious trust-building exercises and deliberation about local problems.</p>

<p>
	<em>Trust building</em>. One key aspect of building trust was to engage without creating expectations. Starting in early 2006, FC hosted a series of community meetings to assemble a priority list of needs using a &ldquo;problem tree.&rdquo; The goal was to mobilize the community to think about its own problems, opportunities and aspirations. Instead of promoting its own programs, FC allowed community members to identify challenges unaided. FC wanted the community to consider it a development partner, rather than an external actor imposing ready-made solutions. Recalls Ladera leader <a href="case_id_131_id_282_c_bio.html">Miriam Gomez:</a></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		They [FC social workers] asked whether we saw needs in the community. We would tell them about lack of employment&hellip; that many people were out of work. Then they would ask us what could be done. They did not know, and wanted to know what we thought could be done.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_942.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	In addition, social worker teams worked with local leaders to introduce FC to the community. They undertook only short-term collaborations with local institutions. For example, they worked with a women&acute;s organization to organize a New Year&rsquo;s celebration. The women had been collecting funds, and FC contributed the balance needed for a successful event. In September 2006, FC organized a Forum of Local Development and Social Building, which brought in public institutions to discuss their different intervention models in the <em>comunas</em>. From this platform emerged an initiative to formalize an inter-institutional network of organizations working in Ladera.</p>
<p>
	FC looked for &ldquo;early victories&rdquo;&mdash;small programs that could start a conversation with locals about social change, and demonstrate quick and beneficial results. Building on each community&rsquo;s conclusions about its problems, FC in in summer 2006 began to offer some of its standard capacity building programs such as free parenting workshops and classes on experimental art, entrepreneurship, and literacy. Ladera leader Gomez observes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		[Before the arrival of FC] we were very disorganized, everyone for himself, everyone minded his own business, cared only for his home, nobody cared whether the street was overgrown, or whether the neighborhood was dirty. But after FC came, we started forming groups; and all began to change around activities that the foundation promoted and shared with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	It partnered with public institutions to bring in existing services such as school meals. It sponsored a group initiative to start a small business that would provide employment for the associates, and provided job skills training and administrative support. Financed by the governor&rsquo;s office, the foundation built a community health center. These actions helped FC become better known in the community and demonstrated its good intentions. But it also wanted to conduct a survey.</p>
<p>
	<em>Survey</em>. To target its efforts most effectively, the foundation needed solid data on social and economic needs. That meant a household survey, both to help design relevant programs and to establish a baseline for future evaluation purposes. Program monitoring and evaluation was not only a fundamental part of the FC model, but a requirement of its external funders. FC knew it needed to involve the community both to build support for and to conduct the survey. It worked with local leaders to organize information sessions and obtain participants&rsquo; consent. FC also prepared a detailed plan for qualitative research (focus groups) and, most important, to deliver the results of the study to the community.</p>
<p>
	The Ladera survey, carried out from May 22-28, 2007, covered 842 households. The foundation invited all employees (including managers) to administer the surveys or help with other logistics. A significant group volunteered and was trained in how to fill out the questionnaires and other research techniques. This strategy proved successful: on the one hand, community members felt that FC had a high level of commitment and engagement; on the other hand, the survey made work more meaningful for many FC employees. After the survey, FC hosted focus groups of local leaders to gather qualitative information to complement the survey results. One theme that emerged was the lack of trained leaders. FC also mobilized resources for construction of the community health center, which opened in December 2007.</p>
<p>
	Finally, some two years after choosing Ladera, FC was ready to present the results of the survey. Between February 21 and April 28, 2008, FC convened 12 meetings, first with leaders and then with the larger community. Together, FC and the community designed a strategy to respond to the identified needs in education, income generation, the physical infrastructure of public spaces, and the desire to strengthen the social fabric.</p>
<p>
	<em>Ladera launch</em>. In April 2008, FC launched its Ladera development program with a full menu of activities. For example, in May, the foundation started <em>truque comunitario </em>or communal barter.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_942.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[10]</a></sup> Based on the assumption that everyone has something to contribute, barter of both tangible and intangible goods&mdash;from a smile to clothes to services&mdash;became a major source of social interaction and the basis for new community networks. Initially, housing had been a priority. But Ladera residents held no title to the land, so FC instead organized families and the municipality in <em>comuna 18</em> to create land titles.</p>
<p>
	In August, acting on suggestions from the community focus groups, it opened a Leaders School. Eighty-two &ldquo;students&rdquo; took an 18-month course in how to organize, mobilize and access public and private support networks.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_942.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[11]</a></sup> The goal was to empower local leaders to find resources and propose solutions on their own. Ladera leader Gomez observes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In Leaders School we realized many things &hellip; that we have rights. It taught us what we didn&rsquo;t know about our rights, how to raise [issues], to engage someone without swearing or anything like that, but to know how to get in [and defend] our position.</p>

</div>
<p>
	Meanwhile, FC searched for outside funding partners for Ladera projects. Typically, FC funded 20 percent of its projects directly, and raised the rest from other donors. In developing a community center and a socio-economic development project for Ladera, for example, FC was able to leverage its own investment with funds from four international institutions: the Autonomous Community of Madrid, LIMMAT Foundation (Switzerland), Codespa Foundation (a Spanish development NGO) and ACTET (Belgian aid). Altogether, they contributed almost &euro;1.5 million (US $2.2 million) over three years, 2008-2010. ACTET and LIMMAT, for example, provided &euro;650,000 (US $950,000) to build the community service center in <em>comuna 18</em>. It opened on July 10, 2010 with services from day care to meals for children, recreation and a learning center. The building included an IT lounge, job skills training workshops, an auditorium, and landscaped space around the five-story building.</p>
<p>
	In other areas, FC offered technical assistance on rainfall management, the relocation of families living on steep land prone to landslides, and an assessment of the local water/sewage system. On the education front, it advanced programs to train teachers and benefit students. For example, between September 2008 and June 2009 more than 150 children who were old for their grade took an accelerated course to return them to grade-level. At the same time, another 450 students participated in a reading program called <em>Palabrario</em>. FC also targeted preschool education. Typically, neighborhood women banded together to care for the youngest children (0 to 6 years). By June 2009, FC had trained 90 caregivers and 43 teachers in early childhood development. Additionally, it improved the physical environment of area kindergartens.</p>
<p>
	An FC strength was its programs for small businesses and entrepreneurship. From July to September 2008, FC surveyed small businesses in the area, and drafted a profile of the business owners and their interest in training. At the same time, it surveyed the working age population in the community. Based on these, FC created a series of training programs to improve people&rsquo;s capacity to generate income, whether as small business owners or as employees. By the end of 2009, FC had trained more than 100 people in trades such as baking, fast food, automobile mechanics or construction. Moreover, more than 50 family-owned small businesses improved their management skills, resulting in increased sales and lower costs.</p>
<p>
	Regardless of the subject area, FC project and program managers focused on serving families in a comprehensive and consistent way. Dulce&rsquo;s department targeted the family as a whole, strengthening social networks through community groups and promoting partnerships with other institutions.&nbsp; Social workers were key to helping different programs reach different members of the same families, and to creating a sense of common community purpose. Dulce was gratified to see that the integrated approach was working. As he observes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Today the community in Ladera feels that it is not FC which has brought development, but that they themselves are making use of the opportunities we have come to build with them. While our programs focus on improving conditions of quality of life, our efforts have also built local capacity.</p>
