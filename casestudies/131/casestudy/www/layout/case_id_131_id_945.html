	FC had first to let the selected communities know they had been chosen. On January 24 and 25, 2012, the team convened a meeting in the Buenaventura office with community leaders. The team described its intention to work with them. It explained FC&rsquo;s development approach and its expectation of collaboration. As Buenaventura Team Manager Saa recalls:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		These were our credentials: we arrived saying, we are not here to simply add names on an assistance sheet. We do not bring ready-made solutions in the form of projects that we will implement no matter what. What we bring is a long-term plan&mdash;a proposal to work together. We first need to know each other, so that together we can build the solutions to the problems of the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	After the first meeting, each local leader organized a follow-up in his/her neighborhood. The FC team attended and again communicated the plan, the expectations and FC&rsquo;s work. Participants were able to ask questions, and see the FC staff for themselves. FC made clear it would not replace the state; its role would be engagement with an active community in pursuit of local development. Community participation was crucial, they emphasized. &ldquo;You can argue that it became more like a collective covenant that legitimized the beginning of the intervention,&rdquo; says Tunubal&aacute;.</p>
<p>
	<em>Dulce in charge</em>. By the beginning of 2012, Dulce had been working with FC for about five years. He had been deeply involved in the development of the integrated and territorial approach. He had led the process of compiling lessons learned into a single model with a protocol for future interventions. The model had become stronger and more clearly defined. However, in Dulce&rsquo;s mind it was still a work in progress and would probably always be.</p>

</div>
<p>
	When FC started thinking about Buenaventura and during the implementation of some of the preliminary programs, Dulce as head of the Social Development Department had provided guidance and support for the team&rsquo;s daily work. But in January 2012, Pizarro put him in charge of the entire Buenaventura operation. The assignment came as a bit of a surprise, because other departments had more experience handling projects outside Cali. But Dulce accepted the job as an opportunity to see whether the success in Ladera had been a fluke, or redounded to the credit of FC&rsquo;s integrated, family-focused, geographically targeted development strategy.</p>
<p>
	Buenaventura, Dulce was aware, posed one of the biggest challenges FC had faced in years; the potential for failure was considerable. He knew that without the trust and buy-in of the community, there would be little progress. Over the years, many organizations with good intentions had come to Buenaventura; too many had dropped out, mission not accomplished. For locals, those failures bred mistrust of outside interference, and impatience with promises.</p>
<p>
	As he considered the scope of FC&rsquo;s proposed involvement in Buenaventura, Dulce wondered how to ensure the security of both staff and local partners. The area continued volatile, with active remnants of the armed groups that for so long had destabilized it. Illegal activities no doubt continued as well. FC would have to win the trust of the community and, in turn, rely on it for its own security. Dulce was prepared, as in Ladera, for a lengthy period of trust-building activities.</p>
<p>
	<em>Deadline</em>. Thus, he was surprised when Pizarro asked him to complete the survey of the selected districts&rsquo; socioeconomic conditions before April 2012. Dulce was far from persuaded that the time was right. This was going to be FC&rsquo;s first major operation outside Cali. He had hoped for months of small projects that would build FC&rsquo;s credibility in the community and win trust. If things went wrong, chances for a successful development initiative could be compromised, or even lost for good. As he argued:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		We are already in the middle of January. Are we already on [sufficiently] good terms with local leaders? Security and socioeconomic conditions are becoming more complicated. What if we are not able to get the surveys answered because we are rushed out of neighborhoods by the community or armed actors? &hellip; Several institutions have gone there and flamed out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Tunubal&aacute; agreed. She knew how important it was for respondents to answer the questions in the survey truthfully. She hesitated because there had not been a continuous FC presence in all the target neighborhoods. She feared people&mdash;not knowing enough about FC&mdash;would not open their doors to surveyors. &ldquo;I believed we needed more presence on the ground, that people would know us better so that they could say... oh yeah, we know them, the FC people are coming!,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>
	Team Leader Saa, however, had no such doubts. The survey would provide the information FC needed to build a concrete development plan together with the community. He had been waiting for a green light since October 2011, before Pizarro&rsquo;s validation mission delayed the process. Saa had led the Buenaventura team for more than a year and, even with Dulce in charge, retained considerable responsibility. The two men had a positive working relationship. But Saa believed the community was more than ready to take the survey. Residents, he felt, held a positive attitude towards FC; now they wanted to see results. Delaying the survey might in itself be detrimental if the community tired of waiting.</p>
<p>
	At the same time, events in Buenaventura were moving quickly and other aid and government organizations were starting to focus on the community. That represented important opportunities for partnerships and funding that could be lost if FC waited. Even the chief social service agency (the Department for Social Prosperity) wanted to start work. The survey results would present FC with an opportunity to influence policy. Pizarro, while he preferred an early survey, understood the dilemma. &ldquo;There is no way to measure trust; it is a very subjective thing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Knowing when there is enough trust is like a craft.&rdquo; The foundation would have to decide within days: schedule the survey in a hurry for March, or wait until the tested trust-building activities were complete?</p>
