    <div class="content"><p>
	In 2005, the board elected Roberto Pizarro FC executive director. Originally a civil engineer, Pizarro had spent over 30 years working for the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (NFCG), where he held a variety of leadership roles, including director for the chapter of Valle del Cauca state. Coffee growers were mostly small family producers, and the NFCG helped improve their conditions. Pizarro brought more than leadership skills to FC; he understood the local context, and had experience in social development in Valle del Cauca.</p>
<p>
	Pizarro had a new goal for FC: holistic development. Rather than offer unrelated individual programs, he wanted to integrate social, cultural and economic components into each development project. Projects would address the issues in any given geographic area in their entirety, not piece by piece. Finally, rather than looking at individuals in isolation from their families and environment, Pizarro wanted to focus on the family as the unit of intervention. Before, FC had offered different services for different age groups. Now it sought a multiplier effect by targeting programs at an entire household. To achieve integration, Pizarro decided to increase FC&rsquo;s cadre of social workers and deploy them aggressively.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_941_pid_0.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[3]</a></sup> As he puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		What I did was to work a lot to strengthen the social fabric. We expanded the role of social work as part of the approach, because I&rsquo;ve always believed that it is the social connections in a community that really generate trust&hellip; What we have done [differently] has been, first, to better define focus and scope, and second, to deepen the social elements of any particular intervention.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_941_pid_0.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	<em>Dulce arrives.</em> In 2006, Pizarro hired as head of social and community development Dr. Alvaro Dulce, with whom he had worked on development issues at NFCG. Pizarro charged him to identify which social strategies FC should include in future community projects. FC had learned that social change meant behavioral change. It recognized that at the core of any intervention stood a human being, with needs beyond money or material goods. For example, a business owner might benefit from family counseling, which in turn could allow him to profit more fully from an accounting course. FC&rsquo;s holistic approach tried to ensure that any program would benefit the individual, his family <em>and</em> the community.</p>

		Four dimensions of the intervention</p>
</div>
<p>
	Dulce was a medical doctor who early in his career specialized in family and community medicine. He had worked closely with rural communities where he was expected to engage with patients beyond their physical health. He learned to involve himself in the local culture and to promote wellbeing based on family and community concerns. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Being a rural community doctor shapes your understanding of your role; it becomes to promote wellbeing, and not to focus exclusively on the disease. The community health center works as a focal point, but all interventions should eventually be defined by the varied dimensions of the human being.<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_941_pid_0.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	FC wanted Dulce to deploy social workers to strengthen both the social fabric and individual capabilities. Through trial and error, the foundation had developed specific implementation strategies that Dulce&rsquo;s growing department was to expand and standardize:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offer tools to the community for its own development</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strengthen and create new local leadership</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; empower social actors in the area</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stimulate individual and collective self-esteem</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">
	&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begin with a strong presence but with a well-defined exit strategy</p>
<p>
	Dulce&rsquo;s first task was to create a department capable of supporting&mdash;through direct interaction with the community&mdash;all other FC efforts such as education, income generation, housing and the environment. As a start, he created a repository of FC&rsquo;s institutional knowledge about social and community development. Until now, each employee had approached a task as s/he saw fit; there was no standard protocol. Moreover, much of FC&rsquo;s expertise rested with individual employees; when they retired or resigned it went with them. Dulce then integrated his operation into ongoing FC projects. By 2007, he had made great strides: in just a year, the social work staff had grown from 10 to nearly 40.</p>
<p>
	<em>Functional to matrix.</em> At the same time, Pizarro reformed FC&rsquo;s organizational structure. Historically, FC had operated three categories of programs&mdash;education, income generation, and housing development. Each worked separately, with its own hierarchy and decisionmaking process. But with the decision to focus on the family unit, FC wanted to ensure that if one member of a family had contact with an FC program, all other household members would have the opportunity to join FC programs. Social workers, who spent most of their day in the field, would follow up on individual families and their needs.</p>
<p>
	To make the shift, FC in 2008 switched from a pyramidal organizational structure to a matrix with hierarchies for each line of work, but also for each geographic area. This corresponded to the need for cooperation across programs and projects necessary for an integrated approach. The head of each geographic area was put in charge of the comprehensive development strategy, while the director of each development strand was responsible for the particular programs and projects within the overarching strategy. The new matrix structure, as well as the new emphasis on social work, was first tested in a project that had started two years earlier: Ladera.</p>
