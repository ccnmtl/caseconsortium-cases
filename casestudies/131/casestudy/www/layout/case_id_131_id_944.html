	Typically, organizations and government institutions in Buenaventura operated from Cali or Bogot&aacute;. FC by contrast wanted to become part of the city. The first step was to explore it. In early 2011, as it had in Ladera, FC set out to study local dynamics. The goal was to understand the local culture and what local people wanted, their dreams and aspirations. Furthermore, the team needed to identify which institutions already existed so FC could, as its principles stated, work with what was available. Pizarro identifies two key decisions:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		We made two simple choices. They can be very subtle, but for us are critical: to open an office there, a building with a signpost that said Fundaci&oacute;n Carvajal; and the other that is much more subtle, to get a rented apartment where we could accommodate up to 10 people. There is a very powerful message behind that; it says we have come to <em>live</em> in Buenaventura. We want our people to see the dawn in Buenaventura!</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>
	<em>Observe</em>. In February 2011, two FC staff relocated to Buenaventura to make a first assessment and start building connections. One of them was <a href="case_id_131_id_280_c_bio.html">Idalia Tunubal&aacute;</a>, a social worker at FC since 2005 with wide experience in community development in Valle del Cauca. Tunubal&aacute; had been a pioneer in opening the Ladera territory and was recognized for her drive, her people skills and her social development expertise. The other was <a href="case_id_131_id_281_c_bio.html">Juan Diego Saa</a>, who started at FC in January 2010 after earning a master&rsquo;s degree in economic development. He managed an FC project to integrate demobilized combatants into civil society. That had brought him to Buenaventura on a regular basis.</p>
<div style="float:right;padding:10px">
	<img src="../../files/photos/988/Idalia&#32;Tunubala&#32;2.JPG" style="height: 188px; width: 250px;" /><br />
	<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>
	For nine months, Tunubal&aacute; and Saa conducted research. They read everything they could get their hands on about Buenaventura, including government policy documents and reports on health, social indicators, economic development, and so on. In addition, they identified and analyzed the special legal framework that applied to Buenaventura; especially important was Law 70 of 1993 that recognized Afrocolombians&rsquo; collective rights to land and sought to protect the cultural identity of ethnic minorities. After obtaining the available official information, the team established connections with respected institutions working locally, both public and private.</p>
<p>
	FC did have some experience in Buenaventura. As early as 2009, FC had worked on a series of education projects in the municipality, including the rural areas. One, performed under contract to the state secretary of education, had built capacity for nursing and elementary schools students and teachers. Another project focused on helping children aged 9-15 to complete elementary school. In addition, a cargo company operating in the Port of Buenaventura had hired FC to help build a corporate social responsibility program. In early 2011, FC was trying to establish a company owned by dockworkers themselves to eliminate middlemen. FC social workers got to know the workers, their families and some local leaders.</p>
<p>
	These prior commitments provided a platform for direct engagement with other city communities. As in Ladera, an FC team visited different neighborhoods to establish connections first with local leaders, but without raising expectations. FC had not yet identified which specific neighborhoods to focus on. Fortunately, the brand name Carvajal was associated with good quality goods: <em>Carvajal does things right</em> was the corporate slogan for a while, and it stuck in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>
	The Buenaventura team used a matrix, with similar principles but different variables from the one in Ladera, to record the information it had gathered. Says Tunubal&aacute;: &ldquo;We took into account technical as much as human criteria [to select the specific neighborhoods] because we would go there, we would get to know the leaders, we would see the conditions in which people were living&hellip; Then, we would come back to the office and debate.&rdquo;<sup><a href="case_id_131_id_944.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[16]</a></sup> The team came to see that, in Buenaventura, it would have to add questions about gender, ethnicity, age and human rights.</p>
<p>
	In early October 2011, the team was ready to choose specific locales. Using an analysis matrix to compare the <em>comunas</em> in terms of need and potential, the team narrowed the choice to six andforwarded the selections to Pizarro. He decided to ask for a second opinion. Historically, FC had gone after the most challenging situations. However, Pizarro sought advice from an external consultant with expertise in the Pacific region. FC, the consultant opined, would have to balance its commitment to a clear exit strategy against its commitment to focus on the most vulnerable. As Pizarro recalls:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		This was a particularly interesting decision, because it changed our perspective from what we had done in Ladera. We had always said: we will go to the most critical areas, that is our mission. Originally, in Buenaventura we were going in the same direction. However, our consultant, who really knows the Pacific and knows us well, said, &lsquo;I recommend that this time, you go to critical areas, but not necessarily to the most critical areas, because if you go to the most critical, you won&rsquo;t be able to leave for 40 years.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	FC took the consultant&rsquo;s advice and, from October 18-20, dispatched a mission from its Cali office. Mission members seconded the original choice, applauded the criteria developed by the Buenaventura team and narrowed the choice to four <em>comunas</em>: 3 and 5 in the low tide area, and 10 and 12 on the mainland. In total, there were 17 neighborhoods. Recalls Tunubal&aacute;:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Choosing a territory is something rather abstract; you as a social worker have to construct it. Geography per se does not capture all the different aspects of a territory. In a territory you find personal interests and social dynamics, political interests as much as commercial and corporate dynamics. A territory is comprised of people in their complexity, it is not an easy thing to measure. And when one is choosing a territory, one needs to be extremely serious in saying: Yes, I&rsquo;ll work here!</p>

<p>
	FC officially approved the borders of the Buenaventura project in late October 2011. One deciding factor was that the city planned a macro infrastructure project that would eventually require the relocation of communities in the low tide area. Meanwhile, <em>comunas</em> 10 and 12 were targeted by the city for potential urban expansion. Both processes would require assistance and FC thought it could play a strong supporting role in helping people relocate.</p>
<p>
	The team spent November and early December planning (in late December all closed for Christmas). By then, the Buenaventura team had grown beyond Tunubal&aacute; and Saa to a total of six people. As was FC policy, the new staff members were local.</p>
