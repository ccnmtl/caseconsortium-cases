	In December 2005, SIF received its first nirnay from the Nicobars, duly sworn by Ayesha Majid, chairman of the Tribal Council, princess of the realm, and Rasheed&rsquo;s older sister. It documented the council&rsquo;s decision to launch four sustainable development projects in partnership with SIF: a network of cooperative fishing and horticultural societies, a student hostel, training for eco-friendly house construction, and staff support for the NYA. The nirnay provided some briefly sketched budget information, target outcomes, and timelines, as SIF had requested at the exchange visit.<sup><a href="case_id_133_id_959.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>
	Work began on the first two projects right away. In fact, detailed proposals for these undertakings had already been drawn up in Vienna the summer before, in advance of the exchange visit, for purposes of discussion and training, so there were plans the Nicobarese could follow. The cooperative societies were conceived as a way to turn traditional subsistence activities such as fishing, vegetable gardening, and fruit production into cash-producing enterprises that could replace the copra income the Nicobarese had lost to the tsunami. Newly planted coconut palms would not mature for 10-15 years; in the meantime, families could buy shares in their village co-op, provide for their own food security, sell any excess fish or produce to the islands&rsquo; 5,000 resident immigrants, and distribute the profits among themselves.</p>
<p>
	Co-ops were not new to the Nicobarese&mdash;several had been registered under a government program in the late 1990s&mdash;so it was relatively easy to get buy-in from the islanders, and the NYA soon busied itself with the details of preparing bylaws, opening bank accounts, enrolling families, finding boats, pricing freezers, and calculating energy costs. By the time the SIF Steering Committee met again in February 2006, 11 new coops had been registered, SIF having fronted the necessary share capital (&euro;10,000).<sup><a href="case_id_133_id_959.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[44]</a></sup> It was hoped that this money would be returned to SIF when the co-ops were fully operational; in time, profits would be used to support the NYA.<sup><a href="case_id_133_id_959.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[45]</a></sup> In this way, the entire enterprise would be sustainable.</p>

	<em>Hostel project. </em>The second project, a student hostel in Port Blair, was established to house and care for 20 Nicobarese youth pursuing secondary education in the territorial capital, about 250 miles away on South Andaman Island. The sustainability of this project lay in building capacity; the benefit of each child&rsquo;s education would be magnified as the students graduated, went on to higher education and professional training, and returned to the Nicobars as working adults and community leaders who could defend the islands against exploitation. SIF funds paid for rent, food and cutlery, bunks for the girls&rsquo; and boys&rsquo; dormitories, transportation to school, and the services of a house mother; the education itself was free in the government schools. When Singh paid a visit to the hostel in March 2006, he found all in order and was pleased to report that two of the children had represented the Nicobarese Islands in the grand Republic Day Parade in New Delhi two months earlier.<sup><a href="case_id_133_id_959.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>
	The legwork for both these projects was provided by a team of nine NYA staff members who worked under Rasheed&rsquo;s direction. Though the staffers were unpaid after Oxfam left in December, they didn&rsquo;t seem to mind. In fact, they showed a lot of interest in both government and SIF projects, and Ramanujam was busy handling petitions, registration forms, loan applications, and bank drafts on their behalf. Efforts to teach the Nicobarese how to handle such matters themselves were not very successful, but Ramanujam was pleased that some NYA staff were picking up computer skills; a few could even manage Word documents and Excel spreadsheets.<sup><a href="case_id_133_id_959.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[47]</a></sup> Rasheed soon asked SIF to pay for a computer and printer, as well as for salaries, petty cash, and refreshments.<sup><a href="case_id_133_id_959.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[48]</a></sup> The NYA seemed to be settling in for the long haul.</p>
