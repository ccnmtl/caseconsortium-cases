         Cross believed that a student-run news bureau had the potential to offer small, rural papers what he alone could not: a robust reporting presence in
         <st1:city w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
           Frankfort

         . But Cross did not think a Kentucky State-run bureau could succeed in replacing the dwindling capital news coverage. The school’s leadership and faculty were, in his view, too journalistically inexperienced to run a full-fledged news service. Moreover, Cross feared the school’s widely recognized racial and social mission would undermine its credibility as a neutral provider of political news with legislators, journalists, and the public alike. Rather, he held that the

         —with its reputation as one of the top journalism programs in the region—must lead.

         In Cross’ vision,
         <st1:country-region w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
           UK
          </st1:place>
         </st1:country-region>
         would administer the bureau and KSU host it. This meant

           UK
          </st1:place>
         </st1:country-region>
         would hire an experienced political journalist to run it. This director would be supported by a team of retired journalists, each volunteering between 10 and 15 hours a week on a rotating basis to advise students and edit their work. The reporting staff would be drawn from a statewide pool of upper division students, who would live and study in
         <st1:city w:st="on">

         during the spring semester, when the legislature was in session. To solve the problem of year-round reportorial continuity, he proposed that
         <st1:country-region w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
           UK
          </st1:place>
         </st1:country-region>
         develop a master’s program; the graduate students would staff the offices in the summer and fall.

        <p class="final">
         Distribution, Cross figured, was straightforward. Reporters could post stories on a bureau website. The Kentucky Press Association had recently established a story sharing service, which he imagined the bureau could join. Meanwhile he, Barnes,
         <st1:city w:st="on">
          Wilson
         </st1:city>
         , and their colleagues on the

           UK

         </st1:country-region>
         faculty could leverage their relationships with major journalism figures in the state to enlist formal commitments from newspapers, radio, and television stations to run the students’ work. In some respects, Cross’s vision was even more ambitious than the VCU and UMD programs
         <st1:city w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
           Wilson
          </st1:place>
         </st1:city>
         had visited in 2004. Where those schools made it their mission to provide complementary political coverage to their states’ papers, Cross was envisioning a bureau that could eventually serve as a primary political news source for much of the state.
        </p>
        <p>

         <!--<img alt="" border="0" class="audiofile" src="../../files/audios/131/Cross_on_benefits_for_newspapers.mp3"/>-->
        </p>
        <p class="final">
         At the same time, Cross recognized that his more ambitious civic vision for the bureau raised numerous questions. Would the university oversee content? Would client papers have editorial input? Who was liable in the event of libel or other offenses? Then there were revenue questions. Should the news bureau charge fees? Should it be a partnership with the Kentucky Press Association? Would the students be paid for their work? For that matter, would working in the bureau come at a cost to their overall academic experience? Finally, did subsidizing private media companies by offering free content conflict with the university’s educational and civic mission?
        </p>
        <p class="final">
         Barnes understood the conceptual appeal of Cross’s plan, but she did not see how it could work. No one at
         <st1:country-region w:st="on">
          UK
         </st1:country-region>
         had the time to run a

          <st1:place w:st="on">
           Frankfort
          </st1:place>
         </st1:city>
         news bureau. Cross was overcommitted. So were Barnes and the rest of her faculty. Barnes had no money to hire a senior journalist to direct the bureau. Nor could she present mandates to Chapman so long as KSU was financing the bureau as the centerpiece of its proposed journalism program. The choice, it seemed to her, was to continue to serve in an advisory capacity to a KSU-led bureau or pull back and wait, perhaps several more years, to secure funding to launch a UK-run news service.
