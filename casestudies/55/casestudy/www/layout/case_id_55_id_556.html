         Shortly after she was hired in 2003, Wilson, the longtime chief education reporter for the

         discussed with Barnes whether
         <st1:country-region w:st="on">
          UK
         </st1:country-region>
         could simultaneously train students in political journalism and feed

         Barnes liked the idea and, in the spring of 2004, sent

         </st1:city>
         on a fact-finding mission to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and the

          program
         </a>
         was the more ambitious of the two. UMD had set up four independent newsgathering operations, each directed by an experienced journalist. The print side consisted of bureaus in
         <st1:city w:st="on">
          Annapolis
         </st1:city>
         and
         <st1:place w:st="on">

           DC
          </st1:state>
         </st1:place>
         , which supplied daily newsfeeds to newspapers, wire services, radio, television, and online news outlets across the state and country. Students served semester-long tours in the bureaus, wrote 25 to 30 stories in that period and received academic credit for their work. Meanwhile, the school’s broadcast division produced a nightly newscast that reached 400,000 DC households. Finally, the school produced an online news magazine—
         <a class="extlink" href="http://www.newsline.umd.edu/" target="_blank">
          <i style="">
           Maryland Newsline

           Richmond

         , the state capital, and directed by Jeff South, a former editor at the Austin (TX)
         <i style="">
          American Statesman
         </i>
         . He anchored the program around a spring political news course, designed to give students the opportunity to cover the Virginia General Assembly and provide complimentary political coverage to the state’s small weekly, biweekly, and thrice weekly newspapers. VCU’s service scaled back in the summer and fall, when it was primarily used to help students freelance and distribute stories they wrote in other classes.

         inspired by both programs and wrote a memo to Barnes that outlined a long-range plan for
         <st1:place w:st="on">
          <st1:country-region w:st="on">
           UK
          </st1:country-region>
         </st1:place>
         to set up its own capital news service. The first step would be to hire an experienced capital reporter to serve as director. This person, he wrote, would act as bureau chief and seek out partnerships with the state’s media outlets. Students, he envisioned, would then work as temporary employees of participating newspapers. Once the print side was up and running,
         <st1:country-region w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
           UK
          </st1:place>
         </st1:country-region>
         would hire a broadcast director to run television, radio, and online operations. Perhaps, he suggested, the bureau could even be developed in partnership with surrounding schools in the region.

         legislative session happened to mirror the university’s spring term, which solved the problem of matching the academic calendar with the political calendar. So, as a compromise solution,
         <st1:city w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
           Wilson

         proposed that he come out of retirement as an adjunct professor and teach a small, spring-semester, capital reporting seminar. Students in the class would report to Wilson, who would edit the work and seek outlets for their best stories. The seminar was intended more to expose students to civic service than ask them to perform a civic service. As he wrote Barnes in April 2004:
         <o:p>

        <blockquote>

         ran into several teaching and logistical challenges that highlighted the difficulty of simultaneously teaching journalism to undergraduates while asking them to produce publishable work. He initially intended for each student to publish three pieces in the paper per semester. He learned, though, that this was an unreasonable goal. His students took weeks to acculturate to the statehouse and to develop sound enough news judgment to distinguish a story from a term paper. Moreover, he had to instruct them on the inner workings of the legislative process. Finally, the

         Yet the experiment, in Barnes’s view, was more success than failure.

         ’s students had managed to publish several front-page stories in the paper. Barnes was so encouraged by these results that she came to believe that the course could succeed—and even blossom into a full-fledged news service—if she could secure greater institutional support and resolve the logistical problems that made administering it so difficult. As she mulled the options,
