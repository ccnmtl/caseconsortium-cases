         on February 24, 2009, to advise Reed on accreditation. As she pulled into the parking lot, her eye was drawn to an 18-foot, state-of-the-art satellite news truck that took up four spaces in front of the massive red brick building. She had heard about the truck and knew that it was owned by the land grant arm of the university and that it had never been used for journalistic purposes. This mobile studio, she thought longingly, could easily send live video feeds to every newsroom in the state. As if to announce its latent journalistic potential, the phrase “Enter to Learn, Go out to Serve” was emblazoned on its side across a photo illustration of a farm overlooking a panoramic view of downtown

         As Reed led Barnes on a tour of the building, he went over his plans for the new KSU journalism program. He believed that it must be directed by a seasoned journalist, such as himself, who would invest it with a strong journalistic culture.

         The student newspaper, the
         <i style="">
          Thorobred News
         </i>
         , which had been overseen by the university, should be turned into an independent student publication. He wanted the program to train students to work across print, broadcast, and online platforms. He also felt the faculty and curriculum should reflect the university’s core missions of diversity and agricultural development. To that end, he was interested in housing the program in the agricultural arm of the university, where it would be eligible for federal land grant monies, have access to the television truck, and use classroom space in the Cooperative Extension Facility.

        <p class="final">
         Reed was also a convert to the idea of a student-run political reporting service. He had interviewed
         <st1:city w:st="on">
          Wilson
         </st1:city>
         about his capital reporting seminar and had learned about
         <st1:place w:st="on">
          <st1:city w:st="on">
           Wilson
          </st1:city>
         </st1:place>
         ’s loftier, but unrealized, ambition to create a student news bureau. Perhaps, he told Barnes, KSU could pick up where
         <st1:place w:st="on">
          <st1:city w:st="on">
           Wilson
          </st1:city>
         </st1:place>
         had left off and make a news service the centerpiece of a journalism program. He hoped Barnes could advise him on whether such a news bureau would impress the regional accrediting agency, the
         <a class="extlink" href="http://www.sacs.org/" target="_blank">
          Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)
         </a>
         .
         <o:p>
         </o:p>
        </p>
        <p class="final">
         Barnes was intrigued and agreed that a capital news service could distinguish KSU’s journalism program. As she toured the facilities, she could also see why Reed hoped to house it in the land grant arm of the school. In addition to the satellite truck, the Cooperative Extension Facility housed 1,000 square feet of broadcast studio space, a professional control room, audio equipment, new computer labs, conference rooms, and offices—all of which Reed felt was being underutilized by the agriculture faculty for community outreach.
         <o:p>
         </o:p>
        </p>
        <p class="final">
         Indeed, Barnes thought, a KSU/UK partnership might provide the financial and logistical solution she been searching for to launch a bureau. Done right, the two schools—and others that wanted to participate—might be able to lend enough journalistic and academic resources to staff a bureau that could simultaneously serve the educational mission of the university and help satisfy the journalistic needs of the state.

           UK
          </st1:place>
         </st1:country-region>
         faculty, she told Reed, had always imagined a news bureau as a program that would be open to journalism students across the state. Maybe they could explore that possibility? Yes, Reed responded. He had actually thought about inviting students from the surrounding journalism schools—including
         <st1:place w:st="on">
          <st1:country-region w:st="on">
           UK
          </st1:country-region>
         </st1:place>
         —to spend a semester in the bureau and take courses at KSU.
         <o:p>
         </o:p>
        </p>
        <p class="final">
         In return, Barnes suggested that UK might open its Media Law course to KSU journalism students—saving KSU the need to hire a faculty member expert in that area. Barnes left the meeting optimistic about the educational promise of a collaboration. She recalls:

          I was personally very happy. I knew there was no way that we could do more than we had been doing. I didn’t have money to hire someone like [Reed]. And, given that we were geographically close to them, we were the most likely [of the regional schools] to benefit.

         Over the next two months, Reed continued to build on the idea of a student news bureau and, in April 2009, he prominently featured the bureau in a strategic proposal he submitted to Chapman:

        <blockquote>
         <p class="blockquote">
          Almost everyone I interviewed thought it would be a wonderful idea to establish a State Student News Bureau that would be based at KSU. Under this program, JMC [journalism and mass communications] students from around the state would spend a semester in Frankfort covering state government for their college media outlets or any commercial enterprise that needs print, video, or photos on something happening in state government.

         Reed, however, had also learned in the course of his research that he would not be heading the new department. That spring, SACS had informed KSU that at least a quarter of its journalism courses had to be taught by faculty with a terminal degree in order for the program to meet the organization’s accreditation guidelines. This meant that any candidates for hire—including a new director—would likely need a PhD to be considered. Shortly after he submitted his report to Chapman, Reed sent out a message on the listserv for the
         <a class="extlink" href="http://Kentucky Press Association" target="_blank">
          Kentucky Press Association (KPA)
         </a>
         inviting properly credentialed journalists to submit their names for consideration. No one responded. The doctoral requirement had effectively ruled out every senior journalist in the state.
         <o:p>
         </o:p>
        </p>
        <p class="final">
         Barnes was not surprised by SACS’s recommendation. Nor did she think it necessarily ruled out the possibility of a bureau. She could certainly imagine a scenario in which KSU hired a program director with the proper academic pedigree and then a journalist to direct the bureau. However, she also knew that a journalism program’s vision and culture derived from its administrative leadership. In that light, SACS’s requirement threw KSU’s journalistic inexperience into sharp relief and raised the question of whether it was capable of launching and administering a topnotch training ground for political journalism students, let alone a full-fledged news service.
