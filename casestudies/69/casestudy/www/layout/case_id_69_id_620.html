	Before <a href="case_id_69_id_168_c_bio.html">Goldberg</a> took over officially, the two held conversations about Rosenberg (among many other matters). Clifton told Goldberg he had considered reassigning Rosenberg to another beat, but had decided to leave the matter for his successor to resolve. Clifton listed a whole &ldquo;raft of concerns&rdquo; about Rosenberg, including worries that the critic was biased and endangering the credibility of the paper.<a href="case_id_69_id_620.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>
	Goldberg heard more when she took the reins fulltime. &ldquo;One of the things that really caught my attention on coming to the <em>Plain Dealer</em> was just this flood of complaints that I got when I walked into the door about Don&rsquo;s coverage, about how people felt it was biased, it was unfair, that it seemed nasty, kind of personally motivated in some cases,&rdquo; she said.<a href="case_id_69_id_620.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The new editor decided to get to know Rosenberg and talk to him.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>On his beat</em>.</strong> On Saturday, July 7, about five weeks after her arrival, Goldberg accompanied Rosenberg to a concert he was going to review. They drove to Blossom Music Center, the open-air venue for the Cleveland Orchestra&rsquo;s summer series, for the concert and dinner. That night, the orchestra performed Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony, led by Welser-M&ouml;st. &ldquo;I really wanted to see Blossom, see the orchestra, listen to Don&rsquo;s concerns, because he really felt like he needed to get all of his concerns off his chest,&rdquo; Goldberg said. She let him do most of the talking.</p>
<p>
	Rosenberg opted to be candid with his new editor. He told her that orchestra supporters had started a campaign against him and that he believed Welser-M&ouml;st was second rate. Goldberg told Rosenberg that critics are hired for their opinions, a statement that he found encouraging. She also expressed surprise at the volume and kind of feedback she had received from readers about his reporting and reviews.</p>
<p>
	Rosenberg did mention Welser-M&ouml;st&rsquo;s personal life, specifically that the conductor had married his stepmother. Goldberg was surprised. &ldquo;I just thought it was this really odd thing for him to be talking about the man in a way that was supposed to indicate he was an odd guy, a weird guy, in the middle of a conversation that was really a professional conversation,&rdquo; she said. She wondered whether this was one of the reasons Rosenberg found the conductor objectionable.</p>
<p>
	That night, Rosenberg wrote a positive review of the performance. On July 9, Rosenberg emailed Goldberg: &ldquo;Susan, thanks for a wonderful evening Saturday. It was a real pleasure.&rdquo;<a href="case_id_69_id_620.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Rosenberg attached a column of his that her predecessor, Clifton, had killed and that he had mentioned to her the night they were at Blossom. &ldquo;Let me know what you think,&rdquo; he wrote.<a href="case_id_69_id_620.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Goldberg read the column and replied that she would have changed some words. &ldquo;[B]ut I don&rsquo;t understand why the column was killed,&rdquo; she wrote diplomatically. She did not want to rehash an old clash that predated her. Additionally, she didn&rsquo;t know Rosenberg well. &ldquo;I was trying to manage the situation and move forward,&rdquo; Goldberg said.</p>
