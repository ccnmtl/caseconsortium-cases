         In late January, MAA Executive Director Hanson contacted Goldberg, and she went to his office at Severance Hall. They did not know each other well, and the meeting was framed as a get-acquainted session and opportunity for frank discussion of several issues. The complaints Hanson voiced about the newspaper’s coverage of the Cleveland Orchestra were hardly new. But Hanson had more to say.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 1998, he told her, Rosenberg was with the Cleveland Orchestra in China. Then-Music Director Dohnányi had had a major argument with Hanson’s predecessor. People had stormed out of the room. In Hanson’s estimation, the episode was newsworthy and yet—he charged—Rosenberg never wrote about it.
         <a href="case_id_69_id_623.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">
          [1]
         </a>
         The reason, he alleged, was Rosenberg and Dohnányi’s close personal relationship. Hanson admitted that he, too, had once been friends with Rosenberg.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was news to Goldberg, who had not known of these friendships. “It concerns me as an editor if one of our reporters has become really good friends with someone they cover,” said Goldberg. When she returned to the office, she described the meeting to Van Tassel. After discussion, Goldberg suggested another meeting with MAA representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           February meeting
          </em>
          .
         </strong>
         Goldberg invited MAA Executive Director Hanson and Board President Ireland to meet with her, AME Van Tassel, Arts Editor Kappes, and Managing Editor Simmons on February 4, 2008. Goldberg wanted the other editors to hear Hanson’s concerns. The two MAA representatives believed that Rosenberg held a personal grudge against Welser-Möst and that his reviews favored guest conductors. Listening to them talk, Goldberg thought, “Here we go again.”
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          My sense was that this was the same stuff I had been hearing from the moment I got to the paper, and even before I got to the paper.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Van Tassel went into the meeting confident that while Rosenberg had made some mistakes along the way, basically “he’s a good guy and he has a lot of integrity.” Earlier missteps had not been corrected at the time, and now the situation had escalated. She had taken the complaints—many from hardcore orchestra patrons with ties to the board—with a grain of salt. Like any other critic, Rosenberg had his fans and his detractors. But listening to the MAA visitors, Van Tassel began to ask herself whether his detractors might have a point about his remarks seeming personal. “They seemed to be
         <em>
          ad hominem
         </em>
         critiques of the concerts rather than about the program or the music,” she says.
        </p>
        <p>
         After Hanson and Ireland left, Goldberg asked her colleagues Van Tassel, Kappes, and Simmons for their thoughts about the meeting and suggestions for next steps. Firing Rosenberg was not an option they considered; the union would contest it, and the editors had no desire to force him off the paper. The group came up with a couple of ideas. One possibility was to move another reporter, Zachary Lewis, to features. The
         <em>
          Plain Dealer
         </em>
         had just hired the 30-year-old Lewis a few months earlier to cover health and business. But he had interned at the paper years earlier, in summer 1999, and Rosenberg had been his mentor. The two had worked well together back then. Lewis in the intervening years had been a freelance arts journalist covering music, dance, theater, and art for several publications, including
         <em>
          Time Out Chicago
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          Dance
         </em>
         <em>
          Magazine
         </em>
         , and the
         <em>
          Plain Dealer
         </em>
         itself. Perhaps Rosenberg would welcome Lewis as a music features writer, or occasional music critic. His first assignment could be an updated Welser-Möst profile.
        </p>
        <p>
         The editors agreed to let Rosenberg know that they had met with the MAA executives and what they had discussed. A few days later, Goldberg invited Rosenberg to join the same small group. She put the difficulty to him straight. “We [have] had a problem for years,” she told him. “We [have] finally got to where we need to address this problem. What are we going to do about this?” His orchestra reviews, she declared, were eroding the newspaper’s credibility in the community. Rosenberg disagreed. “I have strong views about Welser-Möst, and I don’t see how that compromises the newspaper,” he says.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Was the problem that I had a strong view of the musical director? That was the problem. That was what they perceived to be the problem. Rather than trying to understand that, hey, maybe Welser-Möst is a problem, they made me the problem.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Goldberg considered the options. Personally, she leaned toward bringing in Lewis. The editors could point out to Rosenberg that, since Salisbury’s retirement, he had been writing about dance as well as music. Lewis could provide relief for Rosenberg’s double workload. But what should Lewis be asked to do? Straight features? Or could he take over music reviews? If so, all of them? Goldberg could assign Lewis to review the Cleveland Orchestra fulltime—which would remove Rosenberg from contact with the ensemble. Or she could assign Lewis to review the orchestra only when Welser-Möst conducted. Finally, she could simply appoint Lewis the paper’s music critic and let Rosenberg do dance and other arts—in effect, take him off the music beat.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whatever the choice, Rosenberg, she anticipated, would be angry. She also worried about the paper’s reputation nationwide among newspaper editors, as well as music and arts critics. As former president of the Music Critics Association, Rosenberg had close ties to the arts criticism community. Had Rosenberg simply exercised his right as a critic to tell readers what he believed? Or had he stepped over an invisible line into
         <em>
          ad hominem
         </em>
         attacks on an otherwise accomplished musician? Would it be fair for the
         <em>
          Plain Dealer
         </em>
         to redefine his job? This was not familiar territory for a newsroom executive, and Goldberg struggled to reach an impartial judgment.

            Rosenberg did in fact write three times in 1998 about the rift between Maestro Dohnányi and the orchestra. He did not report on the angry episode itself. See the Cleveland
            <em>
             Plain Dealer
            </em>
            : “Dohnányi angry over unfinished ‘Ring Cycle’” (June 7); “Dohnányi, trustees confer on tense relations” (September 13); and “Dohnányi, trustees find positive course at meeting” (June 20).
