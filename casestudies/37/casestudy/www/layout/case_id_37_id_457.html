         The
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         was among the largest newspapers in the northwestern United States, with a circulation near 300,000. The paper’s audience centered in Portland, Oregon—where the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         was headquartered—but extended into the surrounding counties and parts of Washington state. Like most major American newspapers, the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         devoted the last two-page spread of its Metro section to opinion writing. The convention had arisen in the mid-19th century as US newspapers, until then often instruments of partisan politics, gradually moved toward presenting the news in an objective, neutral tone to appeal to wider audiences. The opinion pages represented an attempt to separate partisan analysis of current affairs from the facts presented in the news pages.
        </p>
        <p>
         This history was reflected not just in the pages, but also the staff structure, of modern newspaper organizations. A news staff typically reported to a managing editor, in charge of day-to-day newsgathering. A separate opinion staff reported to an editorial page editor, in charge of the opinion pages. The staff separation was meant to ensure that a newspaper’s “editorial slant”—the points of view expressed in its opinion pages—had no impact on the way its reporters gathered and wrote the news. In addition to individual columnists, the opinion staff also included an editorial board—a committee of writers charged with reporting and collaboratively writing a few daily, short arguments about issues facing their community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Founded as a Republican newspaper in 1850, the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         remained editorially conservative for much of its history, endorsing its first Democrat for President with Bill Clinton in 1992. The paper’s editorial slant was determined in part by the priorities of its owners, the Newhouse family, who had purchased the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         in 1950. In theory, the Newhouses could steer its papers’ editorial positions as much or as little as they chose. In practice, the Newhouses, who owned over 30 newspapers nationwide, delegated editorial autonomy to local management at individual newspapers. In the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         ’s case, President and Publisher Fred Stickel appointed the editorial page editor. Himself a staunch conservative, Stickel in 1995 had sought out a political moderate to lead the seven-member board, and had chosen Caldwell. At the time,
         <a href="case_id_37_id_118_c_bio.html">
          Caldwell
         </a>
         was
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         Metro Editor; he was not a registered member of any political party, and he tended to hew to the center. Stickel only occasionally weighed in on editorial decisions, and did not expect Caldwell to defer to his judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ideological composition of the board was not constant over the years as writers came and went, but Caldwell, Stickel, and Sandra Rowe, the paper’s editor, tended to hire experienced, politically moderate reporters for the board. In 2009, most of the board’s members considered themselves in the center-left of the political spectrum. There were six in addition to Caldwell, and they functioned as beat reporters—focusing on law, education or state government, for example. Though each member suggested topics, wrote editorials, and participated in daily discussions about what the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         ’s stance should be, Caldwell himself ultimately determined what positions the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         took. He explains:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          [The board is] not a democracy. I’m responsible for what appears on the editorial page… We don’t vote or anything along those lines. We have discussions. In the end, the author of an editorial and I have to agree what the opinion is going to be and presumably… the opinion presented… is informed by the discussion and the views of other members. [But] we don’t try to reach a consensus and we don’t try to ask people to represent views that they don’t actually own.

         The
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         ’s editorial slant was thus colored by Caldwell’s own idiosyncrasies. For example, not all of Caldwell’s staff agreed with his support for capital punishment, yet the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         ’s official stance was pro-death penalty. Caldwell had also seen to it that the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         endorsed George W. Bush over Vice President Al Gore for President in the hotly contested election of 2000.

         Like most American newspaper editorials,
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         editorials were “unsigned,” that is, their authors’ names were not attached.
         <i>
          New York Times
         </i>
         Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal explained the practice in an online discussion forum with readers:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Editorials are unsigned because they are the product of a group of people, who bring their experience and intellect to bear on a wide range of topics. They are meant to represent an institutional opinion, not a personal opinion. The editorial board is the voice of its board, its editor and the publisher of
          <i>
           The Times
          </i>
          . (By the way, it is most emphatically NOT the voice of the newsroom, which is… entirely separate from my department.)… We are not striving for unanimity and we do not take votes (except for political candidate endorsements, which is a bit more formal process). But we are looking for positions that make sense to this group of highly qualified, educated and deeply experienced professional journalists. They should be based on the principles for which the board stands and grounded in a solid understanding of the facts.

         In addition to overseeing staff editorials, which appeared on the first page of the opinion section, Caldwell also selected letters to the editor for print, and oversaw the contributions of opinion columnists and guest writers. Those columns appeared on the page opposite the editorials; their name, “op-eds,” referred to their position in the newspaper.
