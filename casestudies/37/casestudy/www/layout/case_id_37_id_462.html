         The most dramatic step the board could take would be to ask for Adams’ resignation. If they decided to do so, should they do it immediately, for the next day’s newspaper, or wait? Alternatively, they could urge Portland voters to organize a recall election—but under Oregon law, a recall election could not take place until an official had held office for six months. The board could withhold judgment entirely until more facts about the situation trickled in. Or the board could acknowledge the revelations as embarrassing, but remind voters that Adams was still best-qualified to lead the city among the other candidates who had run against him for mayor. There was no obvious replacement should he leave office, and the board agreed that Portland was badly in need of strong leadership. Attig spoke first. He thought Adams should resign. He says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          He admitted that he’d lied to voters… and didn’t feel that he could tell the truth prior to the election and still get elected… And if he felt that way, then I think I felt that way, and that he shouldn’t be in office…This was such a fundamental deception.
         </p>
        </blockquote>

         </br>
        </p>
        <p>
         But if they did ask for Adams’ resignation, Sarasohn reflects, “you have to consider why it is that you’re asking him to resign. Is it because he had sex with a teenager? That’s tacky, but if his most recent story holds up, not illegal.” Caldwell worried that even if the board cited the lie, rather than the affair itself, as the reason Adams should resign, readers might misinterpret their stance. Caldwell says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I worried… that people would think that we based this recommendation on the fact that he had had this affair with such a young person, or… more broadly, that we had based this argument on the fact that he had had an affair with
          <i>
           anybody
          </i>
          , or anybody of the same sex.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Nielsen, meanwhile, leaned toward calling for Adams’ resignation but was wary. She says that she reflected: “Are we overreacting, for whatever reason, either as a group or individually, and are [we] overreacting because it’s a surprise?”
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Are [we] overreacting because he’s gay? Are [we] overreacting because he’s a new mayor?... You don’t want to overreact and… you want to think about [the] long-term credibility of the newspaper as an institution and of the editorial board, and you don’t want to just call for people’s resignations willy-nilly, because… over the course of 10 years, a lot of people screw up, and you can’t just call for everybody’s resignation.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Kitch, who as the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         ’s lead writer on Portland politics had personally covered Adams for several years, was disgusted by Adams’ lie.
         <span>
          But she was also deeply disappointed that Portland might lose a much-needed leader.
         </span>
         She remarks:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          There was such a pent-up longing for an activist mayor, and we suddenly had one. Because he actually won in the primary, he’d had six months of lead time… when he was revving up to be mayor. So he had a lot of rehearsal time where we saw him on the stage, and we saw him getting ready and doing all the right sort of things. And, because of that, when this came out, I think the first response that many people had, quite understandably, was, this is crushing… There really isn’t anyone saddled up and ready to go in these directions. And so there was a calculation about, well, do we just forget all of that and bet on a new horse, or do we say, heck, this guy’s too good to lose?

         What kind of editorial would best serve their readers? How much weight should Caldwell afford anticipated reader reaction in choosing the
         <i>
          Oregonian
         </i>
         ’s editorial stance? Was their responsibility merely to state an opinion on the matter or should their work be guided by some other principle? What effect would demanding Adams’ resignation have in the gay community, and should the board take a possible backlash into account? It was Caldwell’s decision.
