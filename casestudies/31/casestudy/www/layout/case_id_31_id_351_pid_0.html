<p>In the fall of 2003, <i>Chicago Tribune </i>education reporter Stephanie Banchero decided to take a fresh look at the effects of the 2001 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act. The law was relatively new and had promised to revolutionize education, especially for poor people living in districts with failing schools. A key piece of the legislation was the so-called &ldquo;choice provision,&rdquo; which allowed students in failing schools to transfer to better ones, with state governments providing the necessary transportation. Banchero was curious: What exactly was the experience of a child who took advantage of this opportunity?</p>
<p>Banchero was an old hand at reporting on education, and had written numerous stories on the public policy choices and trade-offs embedded in NCLB. But she was less experienced in long-form, human interest journalism. She set herself an ambitious professional goal when she decided that the best way to answer her question was to track one transfer student for an entire school year. Banchero quickly located a child who met her criterion: a reasonably strong student who would likely benefit from a better learning environment. Third-grader Rayola Carwell also satisfied Banchero&rsquo;s goal of finding a child with an involved parent. Yolanda Carwell, an African-American unmarried mother of three, spoke impressively about her commitment to improved opportunities for her children. Banchero started to follow Rayola as she enrolled in a new school, Stockton Elementary, on the North Side of Chicago.</p>
<p>This assignment not only presented a new reporting style for Banchero; it also put her in unfamiliar territory in the newsroom. To Banchero&rsquo;s disappointment, her editor had been tepid to the idea. The reporter, however, believed that she was on to something important. So taking an unusual step, Banchero decided to report it in the early mornings so it wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with her daily beat coverage. She worked on that schedule until January 2004, when Banchero&rsquo;s editors&mdash;acknowledging her tenacity&mdash;assigned her story to the paper&rsquo;s Projects Team.</p>
<p>By February, however, Banchero began to wonder whether maybe her original editors had been right to have been noncommittal. The story was not playing out as Banchero had hoped. Instead of an article about the policy consequences of NCLB, Banchero had amassed a tangle of material about an earnest child eager to learn, but hamstrung by her mother&rsquo;s own struggles. There was a policy angle: Had the state provided the transportation NCLB mandated, Rayola might well have succeeded. But her failure&mdash;by mid-year, she had left the Stockton school&mdash;had many causes besides shortcomings in the legislation. Among them was Yolanda Carwell&rsquo;s inability to keep a job or establish a routine for her children. The story, her editors told Banchero, was not whether NCLB worked or not, but how family environment mattered as much as legislation to a child&rsquo;s success in school. The story was as much about Yolanda as Rayola.</p>
<p>This put Banchero in a quandary. Like all effective journalists, she had worked hard to win the trust of her subjects. In the months Banchero had spent with the Carwells, the family had grown comfortable and unguarded in the reporter&rsquo;s presence. This now posed a problem. Did Carwell still understand&mdash;as she had at first&mdash;that the comments she had made over months of conversations could be used in the article? Although Banchero had told Carwell that she, in addition to her daughter, would be featured in the story, she wanted to be sure Carwell had understood how central a character she was becoming.</p>
<p>Banchero also wanted Carwell to know that her background would be subject to rigorous investigation and fact checking&mdash;and that the story might not be a favorable one. Indeed, Banchero herself had not anticipated the story&rsquo;s focus shifting in this way. Banchero felt a keen responsibility to her source&mdash;in this case a poorly educated, disadvantaged single mother. But she also wanted to finish reporting what she and her editors considered an important and valuable story. Banchero had intended to follow Rayola to the end of the school year. If she told Carwell what she intended to write, might Carwell block Banchero&rsquo;s continued access to her daughter?</p></div>
