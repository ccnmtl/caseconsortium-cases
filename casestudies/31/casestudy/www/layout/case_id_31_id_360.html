          Rayola Carwell exhausted at school.

         As the fall wore on, however, something changed. Rayola often seemed sluggish in class. Especially in the mornings, she sat through the most important 2 1/2 hours of the day—those that covered reading and math—struggling to stay awake. Banchero realized that Rayola and her brothers not only got up early; they also usually arrived too late for the free breakfast at school. Rayola was both sleep-deprived and hungry. That was when she arrived at school at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         Often, the Carwell children missed school altogether. Several mornings a week, Banchero went to the Carwells’ house at 6 a.m., and waited outside in her car. In October and on into November, more often than not the house stayed dark until 8—too late for the Carwells to make it to school on time, either by car or public transport. At that point Banchero, not wanting to intrude on the story, left for the
         <i>
          Tribune
         </i>
         . When she called Stockton later that day to find out if Rayola and her brothers had come to school, the answer was usually “no.”
        </p>

           Yolanda Carwell
          </i>
          .
         </b>
         The problem, Banchero slowly acknowledged, was Yolanda Carwell. Carwell had chosen Stockton simply because she had recognized the name. She had not done enough research to discover how prohibitively far away it was. Although Banchero wanted to give Carwell the benefit of the doubt, she began to see that this behavior was typical. Despite her effusiveness on the first day of school, Carwell had trouble following through on resolutions. She often missed appointments, failed to return phone calls, and let opportunities pass her by.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were other warning signs in Carwell’s behavior. Stockton Elementary had a separate program that worked with families to resolve issues outside the classroom. Ada Ortiz, a social worker Stockton assigned to help Carwell find a steady job and a home closer to the school, soon grew frustrated with her. At first, Carwell was engaged and seemed to like the idea of finding a new house and a higher-paying job. “To me, that even made it more interesting because here was someone who, even though she’s not the perfect mom, she’s trying to make it work,” Banchero says.
        </p>
        <p>
         But these efforts soon fell through. Ortiz arranged several job interviews and appointments, but Carwell missed many of them. If she did arrive, other things went wrong: Carwell agreed to rent a nearby apartment, but when it came time for her to pay her half of the deposit, Carwell was nowhere to be found. Another time, Carwell simply failed to submit proper paperwork, and lost the apartment. Once Ortiz, anticipating Carwell’s failure to follow up, drove her to the offices of a company that was hiring drivers to shuttle patients to and from doctors’ appointments. After filling in applications and sitting for an interview, Carwell received an offer for a relatively well-paying job as a driver. The company even offered to take Carwell’s children to school in the mornings, a boon since Carwell was having trouble transporting them on her own. But when the company tried to schedule training, Carwell never returned their calls and the job slipped away.

         By mid-November, Rayola had missed 14 of 46 days of school, was late another 12, and her academic performance was starting to suffer. Despite her intense focus and hard work, Rayola missed crucial parts of the curriculum: proper nouns in English and carrying in math. Without those fundamentals, she was starting to have trouble with the more advanced lessons, and the progress she had made in her first few weeks was beginning to decelerate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Banchero thought at first that Rayola’s attendance problems were due to the transportation challenge—13 miles was a long way on public transport. But this was only one part of a larger picture. Shut in her room and disengaged, Carwell often let Rayola and her brothers stay up late watching television, which made it nearly impossible to wake them and get them out of the house in time: To make it to Stockton by the 9:20 bell, the kids had to be up by 6 a.m. Moreover, Carwell herself often had trouble waking up. Banchero never rang the doorbell, but it was hard to sit in her car and watch as the house stayed dark into the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ironically, when Carwell actually took a job, she made matters worse. She briefly worked at an early-morning job, which made taking her children to Stockton impossible. On those days, the children’s aunt or grandmother took them, but the grandmother was too arthritic to walk, and so shepherded Rayola and her brothers on an even longer, more circuitous route. When there was no one to take them, the children simply stayed home. Soon Carwell quit the job, which Banchero learned was also characteristic behavior: Carwell never stayed in any job for too long. Occasionally, when she was between jobs, Carwell was forced to dip into the $191 monthly school transportation allowance the state gave her to pay instead for groceries or other necessities. At times, this meant she had no money for gas.

         As Rayola’s absences mounted and her progress in Fromm’s classroom stalled, Banchero started to realize that her original premise was evaporating. To the extent possible, Rayola was working hard and taking advantage of the transfer to a better school, but Carwell was unintentionally hampering her success. This had little to do with NCLB’s choice provision or the transportation issue. As Thanksgiving approached, Banchero wondered whether Rayola remained a good subject. She questioned the value of writing a story that could lead readers to dismiss NCLB’s potential because of one impoverished and struggling family.
        </p>
        <p>
         At a loss, Banchero grew increasingly frustrated with Carwell. Grumman, who had followed Banchero’s reporting closely and was advising her on the story daily, says “she was just so incredibly frustrated by it that she didn’t know what to do.” Grumman encouraged Banchero to keep digging, however. Kiernan, who by that point was functioning as Banchero’s de facto adviser, echoed Grumman. So instead of abandoning a story that seemed to be coming apart, Banchero continued to go to Stockton three mornings a week.
