    <div class="content"><p>On September 7, 2003, Banchero and a photographer, Heather Stone, were assigned to produce a standard first-day-of-school story. They headed to Stockton Elementary in Uptown, a racially integrated neighborhood on Chicago&rsquo;s North Side. Because it was a good school with small class sizes and improving test scores, Banchero thought that she might well find an NCLB transfer student at Stockton. Sure enough, a crowd of children and parents were in the school&rsquo;s office signing up for classes. All of them had transferred to Stockton from failing schools. As Banchero interviewed them for her daily story, she simultaneously screened them for a child to shadow for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Banchero tried to be quasi-scientific in making her choice. Hoping to control for certain variables, Banchero wanted a good student from a good home who could thrive in a better school. &ldquo;What I wanted to show is, could this law work for a good student?&rdquo; Banchero says of her criteria.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to set too many parameters, but I didn&rsquo;t want to pick a family where the kid has special ed needs. That wouldn&rsquo;t have been a fair way to [do it]. So we tried to look for an average to good student where, if she could just get into a good school, it would work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banchero was quickly able to eliminate most of the 14 children in the office that morning. They either had special needs or were too young to articulate their thoughts and impressions. Banchero felt that, for this story, the subject had to be old enough to &ldquo;be introspective about themselves and what&rsquo;s going on in their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Finding a subject.</i></b><i> </i>But one parent caught Banchero&rsquo;s attention. Yolanda Carwell, an African-American single mother in her early 30s, had three children (two sons and a daughter) whom she was transferring to Stockton from a failing school&mdash;Holmes Elementary in Englewood, a neighborhood on the city&rsquo;s South Side. When Banchero interviewed Carwell for the following day&rsquo;s story, Carwell said she felt like she had &ldquo;won the lottery&rdquo; when she learned that she could transfer her kids into such a nice school.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="case_id_31_id_355.html#_ftn1"><span><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> Carwell, who had dropped out of high school at 17, spoke credibly about her commitment to helping her children do better. Banchero was impressed that Carwell herself was studying for the GED (General Educational Development), a substitute for a high-school diploma. &ldquo;She said all the right things,&rdquo; Banchero recalls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She said exactly what you would want to hear. She said, &ldquo;I was a high-school dropout and I want my kid to get a better education,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I know the value of education,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my kids to end up like me and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I have to drive them to another state, I want them to go to a good school.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, Banchero figured, was the kind of parent that NCLB was designed for: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s somebody who was willing to do the work, and the government will help you,&rdquo; says Banchero. The reporter felt that, of Carwell&rsquo;s three children, one would make a fine subject: the daughter. Rayola was in fourth grade and seemed sharp: Carwell said she had even earned straight A&rsquo;s at her old school. The Carwells seemed, Banchero says, &ldquo;like the perfect family.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>What next?</i> </b>Banchero had found her subject, but she was far less clear on how to proceed. The goal was a story from the frontlines of a school classroom on how NCLB was working. But Banchero was not certain of what to look for, what pitfalls to avoid or that she would even be able to cull a meaningful story from following just one student. Nevertheless, Banchero hoped that a story would emerge as she went along. &ldquo;I sort of went in blind,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what [the story] was going to be. I didn&rsquo;t know how often I was going to be with [the Carwells], I didn&rsquo;t know if it was going to be a story. I was just sort of casting about to see what would happen. But so much happened in the first week that it became clear that this was a good story.</p>
