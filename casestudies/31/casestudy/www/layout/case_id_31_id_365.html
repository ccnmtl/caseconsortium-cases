         But her editors were firm. By the end of March, Banchero agreed that Carwell was a key actor in Rayolas drama, and that the story had to include a profile of the mother. To assuage her misgivings, the editors tried to point out the positive aspects of Carwells mothering. They emphasized her agency in the transfer process, and her tremendous influence on all aspects of her childrens lives. I remember telling Stephanie what an impressive thing it was for [Carwell] to get involved with this program in the first place, Papajohn recalls. She had to have some vision of a better life, and she had to take a positive step to make this happen, to make the transfer. And so that obviously is part of the story. It wasnt like [Rayola] was picked [out] by the school. It wasnt a passive thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         None of this, however, helped Banchero resolve her immediate dilemma: What to tell Carwell? She had to inform her about the planned second chapter in the series. The problem was her reaction. Would she be furious? Would she refuse to answer questions about herself? Would she forbid Banchero to report further on Rayola? Did that matter? To what extent did Banchero still need Carwells cooperation?
        </p>
        <p>
         Her friend and colleague Grumman counseled Banchero to simply explain the altered scope of her article. It was irrelevant if Carwell became angry or felt betrayed, Grumman argued. [Bancheros] job was about telling the truth, says Grumman. It wasn't telling just a piece of the truth. And sometimes we stumble over larger truths in this pursuit of finding a narrower one. Her editors on the Projects Team, who lacked the personal ties Banchero had developed with the family, had the same advice.

         Blau and Papajohn insisted that Banchero tell Carwell the facts of the story before it went to press. We aimed to ensure Carwell would get a chance to hear what [Banchero] had found before it was in the paper, say Blau and Papajohn.

         Adds Papajohn: The goal remained the same from when she started out: How do we shine a light on this larger issue?
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Nobody sets out writing a story thinking, well, Im writing this story in order to please the person Im writing about. I think what we want to do is find a way to be fair to people we write about, who give us access to their lives, and to feel like weve handled ourselves in an ethical manner, and weve treated them fairly, and that weve given the reader a complete picture. So if the debate came down to, well, shes going to end up being mad at me, or she already is mad at me, I think the response would be, one, you just dont know whats going to anger somebody in these situations. And the goal here is not to foster a relationship between you and the subject of your story. The goal is to present a full and complete picture of the story youre pursuing.
         </p>
        </blockquote>

         Banchero knew that Blau and Papajohn were right. This is what journalism is, this is what we do, Banchero says. We only go for the truth and we dont worry about peoples feelings because that's not what we're here to do. On the other hand, Banchero had spent six months with the Carwells and, as detached as she had tried to be, there was no escaping the fact that she had developed a connection to the family. She wanted to be professional, but she did not want to be cruel. As the decision of how to break the news to Carwell bore down on her, Banchero developed a severe stomach ailment. I just got violently sick over the whole thing because I just felt so bad, Banchero recalls. She knew the time was overdue to correct the situationbut how?
