<p class="caption">Rayola Carwell at Attucks Elementary.<br />
&copy; <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p>
</div>
<p>One day just after Thanksgiving, Stockton&rsquo;s principal decided to confront Carwell with the fact that her children had missed one third of the year&rsquo;s school days. Banchero was there, and listened as Carwell denied there was a problem. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo; she told the principal. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t missed that much school.&rdquo;<a href="case_id_31_id_361_pid_0.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> The conversation quickly escalated as the principal threatened to call social services. Finally, Carwell admitted that the children didn&rsquo;t listen to her and stayed up too late. The principal promised to talk to them.</p>
<p>It seemed that the conversation had been an effective one. For two weeks after the confrontation between Carwell and the principal, Rayola and her brothers were in school and on time every day. Soon, however, the absences resumed and, after Christmas vacation, the Carwell children did not return to Stockton.</p>
<p>Apparently fed up with what she considered a meddling principal, Yolanda Carwell decided to pull her children out of Stockton. As she explained to Banchero, Carwell found a new school for her children by logging onto the school district&rsquo;s website, which listed all the schools in Chicago. She chose Attucks Elementary, which was closer to her home. What Carwell didn&rsquo;t realize, however, was that Attucks was a failing school. She had mixed up the website&rsquo;s categories. Attucks was an all-black school, with classes one-third larger than Stockton&rsquo;s. Only 35 percent of its students passed their state exams, compared to 56 percent at Stockton.<a href="case_id_31_id_361_pid_0.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></span></a> By the time they left Stockton, the Carwell children had missed 24 of 75 days of school, but the pace of the third-grade curriculum at Attucks was so slow that Rayola was still far ahead of her new classmates.</p>
<p>Banchero was stunned. &ldquo;[Stockton officials] tried to do what they could to fix the problem,&rdquo; Banchero says. &ldquo;They just couldn&rsquo;t fix it. Short of going and physically bringing [Rayola], there wasn&rsquo;t anything they could do.&rdquo; To make matters worse, Banchero found herself barred from Attucks. &ldquo;It was a terrible school and the principal prevented me from seeing what was going on in the school,&rdquo; Banchero says.</p>
<p>For most of January, Banchero did not have access to Rayola&rsquo;s new classroom. Banchero suspected that Carwell encouraged the principal to keep her out, but when she questioned Carwell directly, the mother told Banchero that she was welcome to observe Rayola in the classroom. So Banchero confronted Carwell: &ldquo;Tell me now if you don&rsquo;t want me to follow Rayola.&rdquo; Carwell insisted that she had no objection. Banchero also set up a three-way phone conversation with a Chicago Public Schools communications official and Carwell to clarify that she had the mother&rsquo;s ongoing permission to follow Rayola. Finally, Banchero called Arne Duncan, the superintendent of Chicago public schools, who instructed the principal to let Banchero into the school once Banchero had secured Carwell&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p><b><i>End of the story? </i></b>By this point, Banchero was losing faith in her story idea. By placing Rayola in a failing school, Carwell had undermined Banchero&rsquo;s initial thesis. It was only January. Banchero had intended to follow Rayola until June. How could she write about NCLB now? On the other hand, she felt that she had a duty to tell this story. &ldquo;I had a moral and ethical obligation to the subject matter,&rdquo; says Banchero. &ldquo;Most people don&rsquo;t get to see what I was seeing. I had this incredible opportunity to see a law in action, and I felt responsible to the readers, to the community, to Rayola, and to kids like her to tell the story.&rdquo; If she told it well, Banchero reasoned, the piece could help other children like Rayola.</p>
<p>Banchero felt lost. The stress of the project, coupled with her daily workload at the <i>Tribune</i>,was also starting to take a physical toll. &ldquo;She was popping Advils&trade; like Chiclets&trade;,&rdquo; Grumman recalls. Frustrated, confused, and worn down, Banchero was ready to give up on the story. Grumman, however, continued to believe that Banchero was onto something and advised her not to give up. &ldquo;This is a broader story,&rdquo; she told her.</p>
