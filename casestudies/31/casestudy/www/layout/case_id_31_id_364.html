         By March 2004, Associate Managing Editor Blau had become convinced that the story needed a separate, third chapter on Yolanda Carwell. “She was an important figure in the story,” says Blau. “We needed to explore, both her role as a parent and her feelings about how this was working out… and present her as a three-dimensional person.”
         <a href="case_id_31_id_364.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">

          </span>
         </a>
         The additional material would go in between the two chapters on Rayola in school. The other editors agreed with Blau and suggested that Banchero “background” Carwell, a process that meant looking for pertinent legal documents—bankruptcies, criminal, and civil suits—at the courthouse. It was a procedure the
         <i>
          Tribune
         </i>
         followed for any adult appearing prominently in their pages. “You don’t want to have any surprises,” Papajohn explains. “And it’s just a good reflex anyway. It was due diligence.”

         </b>
         Banchero had long been aware that Carwell was an important figure in the story. In fact, she included several anecdotes about her in an early draft. But she was unsure that Carwell merited such intense focus. Though she agreed with her editors that Rayola’s home life was central to her success, Banchero insisted that the story was fundamentally about Rayola and her school year, and pushed back against Blau’s suggestion. “She’s a very diligent, aggressive reporter and outspoken person,” says Papajohn.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          She’s no wallflower. I think she was just questioning, why do we need to do that? She needed to hear the explanations as to why we need to do it. What is the journalistic reason? How is the story better served? How is the public better served? How is the reader better served by doing this type of reporting?
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         In her head, Banchero marshaled her arguments against making Carwell a central character in the story. First, she told herself, reporting on Carwell herself—as she would have to do if the story took this turn—would be laborious and fruitless. “I just felt like, gosh, that’s a waste of time,” Banchero recalls. “She was so much more difficult to report on. Following Rayola was easy: just go to class and you watch her in class; you go over to her house, you watch her at home. The mom was far more complicated. I just didn’t want to go through all that.” Banchero felt that Carwell had seldom been completely forthright with her, and suspected that this was unlikely to change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Banchero also felt it was premature to press Carwell on why she let her children miss school or why the home was often chaotic. “Pushing Yolanda to answer pointed questions about why her kids were missing school might have changed the trajectory of the story,” Banchero says. “I did not want to insert myself into a developing story by asking questions that might make her change her typical routine.”

            </span>
           </span>
          </span>
         </a>
         She adds:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          I wanted her to see me as an embedded reporter simply there to watch the action, not [as] someone who was judging her by asking questions that made her uncomfortable… I wasn’t judgmental. I didn’t ask her those really probing questions in the beginning [because] I didn’t want her to turn off from me.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Second, if an entire chapter focused on Carwell, that meant using material Banchero had already collected during her earlier reporting on Rayola. The two women had spent significant periods of time together, and Banchero had on several occasions interviewed Carwell directly. She had watched her study for the GED, and followed as she hunted for jobs and apartments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Banchero had behaved at all times as a professional reporter, notebook out and visible. She had consistently shown appropriate journalistic distance: She had turned Carwell down when she asked Banchero for money to purchase groceries, and had refrained from taking Rayola and her brothers home when Carwell was late picking them up. But despite Banchero’s care, had Carwell understood that the months of conversation could be used in the story? “For September, October, November, December—four months—I built a relationship with [Carwell] based on the story I thought I was going to write,” says Banchero. It seemed reasonable to assume that Carwell understood that Banchero wasn’t a friend, but a professional reporter. But had she?

        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, Banchero needed Carwell’s cooperation. If Banchero were going to write the last chapter of her story about Rayola, she did not want to risk losing access to the child.
